# song_data_analysis

This is a project that poses questions about country music over a span of fifty years. Songs, lyrics, and metadata were gathered for charted songs. Data about songs on albums or other types of releases connected to charted songs were also gathered to build a control and test group for classification.

This is still a work in progress. Many of the research questions, such as what features can help a machine learning model classify accurately charted and non-charted songs, have yet to be explored and answered sufficiently.
