# song_data_analysis

This is a project that poses questions about country music over a span of fifty years. Songs, lyrics, and metadata were gathered for charted songs. Data about songs on albums or other types of releases connected to charted songs were also gathered to build a control and test group for classification.

This is still a work in progress. Many of the research questions, such as what features can help a machine learning model classify accurately charted and non-charted songs, have yet to be explored and answered sufficiently.

To see what has been done so far, you can open the .rmd file. We have provided all of the code for the project. The pos_songs.csv file is the result of much of the early data manipulation that takes up about the first 3rd of the script. You can feel free to look through this code, but you can also feel free to jump to the code block where we read in the pos_songs.csv file. From there, you can play around with some of our analyses.

It should be noted that, for the purposes of presenting our paper, we moved around a lot of our code blocks, so the presentation of the information in the .rmd file will differ from how we present it in our final paper. Moreover, for purposes of time and scope, some of the calculations we performed did not make it into the final paper.
