Lets pretend we're together all alone

Or is he holding you the way I do

The Germans had the biggest ships that had the biggest guns
The Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And ev'ry British seaman he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The Hood found the Bismark and on that fatal day
The Bismark started firin' fifteen miles away
We gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away the mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people put ev'ry ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismark to the bottom of the sea

We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us
Hit the decks a-runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismark we gotta cut her down

The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the mornin' sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismark made its run
The Admiral of the British fleet said turn those bows around
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismark, they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
Sink the Bismark was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

On a Mississippi riverboat
I used to be known from coast to coast
As the slickest gambler afloat.

I've dealt the cards from Minnesota
To the harbor in New Orleans
I made a lotta big money on the riverboat
I loved a lotta pretty riverboat queens.

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail.

Oh, a big man got on the riverboat
Our last time in St. Paul
He had a lotta money but his luck went bad
And the riverboat won it all.

He said I dealt from the bottom of the deck
And he pulled a shiny knife
But before that gambler lunged at me
My .44 took his life.

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail.

Well, they came on the boat and they took me to jail
When we got to Tennessee
A gamblin' man has very few friends
Guess nobody cared for me.

So I might be here for a many long years
But if I ever get out 
I'm gonna head straight for that levee
And get me a riverboat headin' south.

No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows every-body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground

Flatt and Scruggs

There's a sweet young Miss, I love to kiss, but listen close and hear me.
She's not my only love, I have another love, and she'll just have to share me.
But she's five foot tall, high heel and all, she already knows.
She had some competition, in a composition, known as polka on an old banjo.

Polka on a banjo, make that five string hot.
Polka on a banjo, give it all you've got.
Polka on a banjo, watch them fingers go.
Of all the songs I guess, the one that I love best,

Is the polka on an old banjo.

(Banjo Solo)

And when they start the band, she takes me by the hand, and I begin to swing her.
She knows I never miss, a chance to steal a kiss, or dance the polka with her.
I don't speak a word, once I have heard, the one thing I love so.
She's caught in the middle, she played the second fiddle, to a polka on an old banjo.

A girl and a Mexican soldier

How old was I when I first seen old Rivers?
I can't remember when he weren't around
Well, that old fellow did a heap of work
Spent his whole life walking plowed ground.

He had a one-room shack not far from us
And well, we was about as poor as him
He had one old mule he called Midnight
And I'd trailed along after them.

He used to plow them rows straight and deep
And I'd come along near behind
A-bustin' up clods with my own bare feet
Old Rivers was a friend of mine.

That sun'd get high and that mule would work
Till old Rivers'd say, Whoa!
He'd wipe his brow, lean back on the reins
And talk about a place he was gonna go.

He'd say, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there among the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow.

I got a letter today from the folks back home and
They're all fine and crops is dry
Down at the end my mama said, Son
You know old Rivers died.

Just sittin' here now on this new-plowed earth
Trying to find me a little shade
With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule, old Rivers and me.

Never to return again
With a one-way ticket at the end of the line
He was told by a stranger man

Till she stood over close and hugged me up real tight
I started to stop to get out and run but I didn't wanna miss out on all the fun

My daddy was working
For the weather station
A little bit North of Nome
And I grew up in that frozen country
Where the nights are six months long

I used to play like I was an Eskimo
I put whale oil on my hair
And every night I would beg my folks
Let me sleep in the frigid air

I was seventeen and my voice was changing
But the girls didn't thrill me none
'Cause I longed to go see an Eskimo
On the banks of the old Yukon

One night I slipped from my daddy's house
A little bit north of Nome
I knew that I could get back by morning
'Cause the nights are six months long

And there she was
Sitting on a chunk of ice
Eating a frozen fish
And dipping her friskies
In whale blubbe

And I said, ooga shooga mooshka
Which means the love in my heart
Is a burning

And she said, ooga mooshka nooshka
And that means, back up, buddy
You're melting the ice

I went back home and I told my daddy
About this maiden fair
And how I felt I'd love to melt
Them icicles in her hair

Dad's trembling lips turned purple
And his breath began to freeze
It was then he told me
I could never rub noses
With pretty little Um Shog Nee

He said, son, when you were born
Well, the Eskimo and the white man
Were having a lot of wild parties, see
The Eskimos always brought the ice

Well, they's having a lot of fun, you see
So one night, this Eskimo named Pie Eye
That's right, son, a pie-eyed Eskimo
He stole my little boy and made
A icicle out of him

So I stole you to get even
I was gonna make a
Fudgesicle out of you

But I loved you like you's my very own
And I treated you just, you know
Just like the cold blooded
Little Eskimo that you are

Rub noses with Um Shog Nee no more

But only twenty-seven lived
To walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored
Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinkin' hard
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone

He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty

Shot from behind, I thought he was dead

And late that night I saved the life of Ringo

I nursed him till the danger passed
The days went by, he mended fast
And then from dawn till setting sun
He practiced with that deadly gun
And hour on hour I watched in awe

And I went east and he went west
I took to law and wore a star
While he spread terror near and far

Which one of us would be the best

That he was holed up in the town

And I went in alone to meet Ringo

They said my speed was next to none
But my lightning draw had just begun
When I heard a blast that stung my wrist
The gun went flying from my fist
And I was looking down the bore
Of the deadly .44 of Ringo

Ringo... Ringo...

They say that was the only time
That anyone had seen him smile
He slowly lowered his gun and then
He said to me ""We're even, friend""
And so at last I understood
That there was still a spark of good in Ringo

I blocked the path of his retreat
He turned and stepped into the street
A dozen guns spit fire and lead
A moment later, he laid dead

Nowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo

Who worked down near the Georgia Line
As D.J. in a little country station
Everybody loved him dear
'Cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late
And his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive
She warned against his loss of sleep
And driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five

B.J. the D.J. you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways
Don't see how you can last

Every morning just past four
From the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again
Then at breakneck speed he'd drive
To sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin

His mom said by the radio
Until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright
Then she'd say a little prayer
Giving thanks that he was there
And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn
All the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time
BJ had a lot of nerve
But he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio
The voice she heard she didn't know
B.J.'d never been this late before
But with the road so bad and all
She'd wait a while before she called

They sang the mountain ballads

And the one in the middle was on the right

Well the curtain had ascended 
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered to hear The folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously 
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously 
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear, said, ""Oh dear""

Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land

Made a lot of miles, the first two days

At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down.

I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm.

He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309.""

I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309.""

Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road.""

Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe.""

In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight.

Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white.

Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago.

At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel.

Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line

Tonight I am aching, my body is shaking
Tonight Carmen's coming back home
Tonight there'll be no room for tears in my bedroom
Tonight Carmen's coming back home.

Tonight as I stand here I notice my hand here
Is trembling as never before
My feelings I can't hide, resistance has all died
My pride will rush outside
The moment she walks through the door.

The lips that have kissed her,
That's loved her and missed her
Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment, I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light
I thought of just taking these two hands and breaking
The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating, the woman I've wanted so much.

I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours
I put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling remembering
The way that she tosses her head.

I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to
Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it,
There's no way to hide it
The love that I have for my wife.

And she said, ""Mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

Well, the note said, ""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' 'round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the Secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't Widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin

The odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
With the end growing closer the harder they fought

And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street

He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye

The biggest thing that happens is the county fair,
I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event,
What we call the Carroll County accident.

The wreck was on the highway just inside the line,
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die,
But she lived long enough for her to testify.

Walter Browning was a happy married man,
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand,
But it was gone, nobody kneW just where it went,
He lost it in the Carroll County accident.

Mary Ellen testified that he flagged her down,
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town,
No one ever doubted what she said was true,
'Cause she was well respected in the county too.

I went down to see the wreck like all the rest,
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess,
But I found something no one else had ever seen,
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine.

A little match box circled by a rubber band,
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand,
It took awhile to figure out just what it meant,
The truth about the Carroll County accident.

By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well,
And took a sacred oath that I would never tell,
The truth about the Carroll County accident,

The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.
The time has come for me to pay for

In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain there was no need
She'd smile in Mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from sellin' a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well - the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we worked hard
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.

And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor

Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the time

I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talkin' straight to you and me

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a Man in Black

I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men

And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believin' that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believin' that we all were on their side

Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changin' everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use

There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of

As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

And, oh, I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor

And tried to understand You more than most

No, I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought You knew
In my own way I worshiped You
While even Your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way You go about the things You do

I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, You could have saved

But I believe that in your eyes
This little child was somethin' special
And You wanted it to be with You, no doubt
So without-stretched arms
You beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way You worked it out

Once I saw a young man growin'
Till he neared the age of knowin'
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at Your way of bein' kind

They tried everything in vain
And I was there when they explained it
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess You looked into the future
Watched him turn his back upon You
Lovin' him so much You couldn't take the chance

It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why You've never given up on me

And even when they crucified You

And you've heard almost ev'ry nursery rhyme
So, tonight before you go to sleep
And pray the Lord your soul to keep
Here's mommy's favorite story one more time.

Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
With the softest golden curls you've ever seen.

But then one day, he met this pretty lady
And she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your mommy sad
'Cause, oh, what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far away

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries.

Then it came to pass, the King grew lonely
And the pretty lady wasn't all she seemed
He realized that he was wrong
And started his long journey home
For he misses little Princess and his Queen.

Then he was back and safe inside his castle
And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain
Then the castle rang with laughter
They lived happy ever after
Knowin' he would never leave again.

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story

I searched for a simply way 
To tell her what I had to say
I kissed her then I turned away
Set her free, foolishly, destiny, misery
Tragedy, on our last date.

Brushed the tears from my baby's eyes
Walked away, didn't know

Songman, can you teach me
How to make someone feel good
I think I have a song or two
That I might wanna
Sing like you someday

When I was young
He'd come around from time to time
He could make that old piano ring

I remember how my daddy smiled
A certain kind of smile
With every song his
Little friend would sing

He'd sit there in the parlor
With a twinkle in his eye
Laughing as he had
A taste or two

Then all of us would
Gather round and listen in as
He'd play us every
Song he ever knew

He'd sing of old times
And simple rhymes
He's sing of ladies fair
One song always made
My mama cry

With every tune
He filled the room with
Cowboys, clowns, or kings
You could almost touch them
If you tried

I often wondered
Was he happy all the time
Or did he just play the part

Why he came alone and why
He always left the same
Did he sing to hide a broken heart

Those days are gone forever
But some things remain the same
Though he and his songs
Are both gone out of style

Now the average American father and mother
Own one whole car and half another

Trick to buy, don't you

Is the way we measure a man's success
By the kind of automobile he can afford to buy

Right turn, no turn, must turn, stop
Get out the credit card honey, we're out of gas
Well now, all the cars placed end to end
Would reach to the moon and back again
And there'd probably be some
Fool pull out to pass
Well now, how I yearn for the good old days
Without that carbon monoxide haze
A-hanging over the roar of the interstate
Well if the Lord that made the moon and stars
Would have meant for me and you to have cars
He'd have seen that we was all born

Went to Detroit workin' on the assembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it outta there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least 100 grand

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out my buddy's mobile home
Now up to now my plan went all right
Till we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that somethin' was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53 and
The motor turned out to be a '73 and
When we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit and
With a little bit of help from an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all 3 of 'em come on
The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well that's when we noticed that we only had one tail fin
About that time my wife walked out and
I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said
""Honey, take me for a spin""
So we drove uptown just to get the tags and
I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff and
When they got through the title weighed 60 pounds

I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime

I'm gonna drive everybody wild

"405",7,"8","Red Sovine","I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Trying to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin' away on Channel 1-9
When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line
And he said, ""Breaker 1-9 is anyone there?
Come on back truckers and talk to Teddy Bear.""
I keyed the mike and I said, ""You got it, Teddy Bear.""
And the little boy's voice came back on the air
""Appreciate the breaker who we got on that end?""
I told him my handle and then he began:

""Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air
But you see I get lonely and it helps to talk
Cause that's about all I can do I'm crippled and I can't walk.""
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
And I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked.

""This was my dad's radio"", the little boy said
""But I guess it's mine and mom's now cause my daddy's dead.
Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was tryin' to get home in a blinding snow.
Mom has to work now to make ends meet
And I'm not much help with my two crippled feet.
She says not to worry that we'll make it all right,
But I hear her cryin' sometimes late at night.
You know there's one thing I want more than anything else to see.
Oh I know you guys are too busy to bother with me,
But you see my dad used to take me for rides when he was home.
But I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone.""

Not one breaker came on the old CB as that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville town.

""Dad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year
Why I remember him sayin' 'Someday
This old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear.'
But I know now I'll never get a ride on 18-wheeler again
But this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends
Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
'Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But you give me shout when you're passin' through
And I'll surely be happy to come back to you.""

Well I came back and I said, ""Before you go 10-10
What's your home 20 little CB friend?""
He gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait.
I turned that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street 229
And as I rounded the corner, oh I got one the heck of a shock
18-wheelers were lined up for three city blocks
I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
And that little crippled boy was havin' a ball.
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again
Well you better believe I took my turn ridin' Teddy Bear,
And then carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man.
We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone

He shook my hand with a mile long grin and said, ""So long trucker. I'll catch you again.""
Ah I hit that Interstate with tears in my eyes
I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
Breaker 1-9 came the voice on the air
""Just one word of thanks from mama Teddy Bear.
We wish each and everyone a special prayer for you,
Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true.
I'll sign off now, before I start to cry. May God ride with you. 10-4 and goodbye.""","Teddy Bear","Teddy Bear ",1976,2,303,1,"Single",1,6,1976,1970,373.666666666667,0.0666666666666667,"3",51.1811023622047

His eyes were sharp as razor blades 
His face was leather tan 
His toes were pointed inward from a-hangin' on a horse 
He was an old philosopher, of course
He was so thin I swear you could have used him for a whip 
He had to drink a beer to keep his britches on his hips 
I knew I had to ask him about the mysteries of life
He spit between his boots and he replied,

""Son, it's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, more money.""

He smiled and all his teeth were covered with tobacco stains 
He said, ""It don't do men no good to pray for peace and rain. 
Peace and rain is just a way to say prosperity, 
And buffalo chips is all it means to me.""

I told him I was a poet, I was lookin' for the truth 
I do not care for horses, whiskey, women or the loot 
I said I was a writer, my soul was all on fire 
He looked at me an' he said, ""You are a liar.""

""Son, it's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, more money.""

Well, I was disillusioned, if I say the least 
I grabbed him by the collar and I jerked him to his feet 
There was something cold and shiny layin' by my head 
So I started to believe the things he said

Well, my poet days are over and I'm back to being me

About a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's
Where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl.

I don't recall who sang the song
But I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city,
I remember each and ev'ry word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy
And the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy
Then he had to leave El Paso on the run.

But love was strong he couldn't stay

I can't explain why I should know
The very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear
From life and live another time
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think
That you yourself lived in that other time.

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts
Familar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions
That I've had so long but I have never told
Like every time I fly up through the heavens
And I see you there below

It puts a glow on every face
Of the falling angels of the back street bars

A few more drinks and I might slip to a 5 or even a 4

I sware I'll never do it anymore

On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her, she said, ""I'm no quitter
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings""

In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused; he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shakin', his big heart was breakin'
He turned to the woman and said

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

After he left us, I ordered more whisky
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time

And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

I leaned down and listened
To the request that she made

Do you know, 'You Are My Sunshine'?

He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

""I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willin' to make a deal

When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
And said: ""Boy, let me tell you what

I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you""

The boy said: ""My name's Johnny and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been""

Johnny, you rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The devil opened up his case and he said: ""I'll start this show""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

When the devil finished Johnny said:
""Well, you're pretty good old son
But sit down in that chair, right there
And let me show you how it's done""

Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet

And I've told, you once you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been""

From being alone too long.
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare,
Knowin' well that your best days are gone.

With no one and no place to stay.

Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore
And if love never lasts forever
Tell me what's forever For

Tryin' their best to survive
When right there in their hands is a dying romance
And their not even tryin' to keep it alive

You want a lover with an easy touch

Not come and go in a heated rush

A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams
The ties that once bound her now are broke away
And she's like a baby, just learning how to play.

She never thought that love could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon
When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday.

Now, she's a lady down on love
She needs somebody to gently pick her up
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down.

Well, I know a lady that's down on her love
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch
But work took me a way from home late at nights
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust.

When we had a love so true
You were my confidant you were my closest friend
Someone that I could always turn to

Back in your heart someday

No reason why you and me
Can't get it back together like it used to be

Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name and graveyards full of old black men
And graveyards full of rusted automobiles

Good morning America how are you?
Say, don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Dealin' cards with an old man in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels a rumbling neath the floor
And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Half way home we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again the passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues

In the factories and the fields
In the city streets and the quiet country towns
Working together like spokes inside a wheel
They keep this country turning around.

One night as I was driving through New Mexico
I had the windows wide open
It was cold and I was crying
And I laid her letter on the radio
Then I stopped outside of Tahoe
Through this tiny mining town
At a diner to refill for the ride
And in the wind I heard this crying
Like a heart broke right in two
I turned my collar up and went inside

Well, I saw this smiling waitress
Joshing friendly with these truckers
They'd give her pats and she'd give them shoves
I said: ""Miss, what's that awful crying?""
Everybody laughed and said
""It's the Tomb of the Unknown Love""
And then they pointed out the window to this stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside a hill
And on that winter night, I read these words alone
These words that are haunting me still
It said:

Here lies a young man struck down in his prime
By the awesome burning power of love
He couldn't stand his true love cheatin'
So he shot the girl down
They hung him from that tree up above
I know that local folks say it's the wind
But I know it's crying
From the Tomb of the Unknown Love

So I drove on to my destination
I did the job my heart commanded of me
And when the sheriff sirens came
I didn't even try to fight
They counted ten, I came out at three
So now I guess tomorrow morning
Warden reads some kind of paper
How I'm gonna pay the state for what I've done
Hey, then they'll put the shackles on me
And we'll take a little walk
They won't have to drag me 'cause it's said and done
And maybe someday they can put me up a stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And lovers everywhere can come and read along
These words that will give them a chill
And it'll say:

Stand beside each other come what may

Not just something they would say
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away

Money to burn and the girls were pretty

I met Elvis, Marilynand Johnny B. Goode
Got my guitar painted in the California sun
A red Cadillac having to much fun

He lit a cigar and stuck his hand out


He said son have we got a deal for you
Gonna make you a star give you fifty thousand too

I'll take your money, I'll make you a movie, but I can tell ya' right now I am born to boogie

And I never back down and I love a good challenge

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon frm the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

She was sitting cross-legged on a hood of a Ford
Filing down her nails with a emory board
Talking to her friends about people they knew
And all of the things that young girls do

When she said, ""You see that guy in the baseball cap?
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that.""
Betty said, ""I've seen him at the hardware store.
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure.""

And as they talked a little while he passed by
She smiled at him he just said ""Hi.""
He was thinking to himself as he walked away
Man, I'd like to find a girl like her someday

Young love, strong love, true love
It's a new love
They're gonna make it through the hard times
Walk those lines
Yeah, these ties will bind
Young love

Well, she just couldn't stop herself from thinking 'bout him
And at a store downtown she saw him again
She had both hands full, he held open the door
He said, ""My name is Billy. I've seen you before.

Can I help you with these? Can I give you a ride?
Can I take you out on a Saturday night?""
She didn't have to say what she was feeling inside
He could see the answer shining in her eyes

Well, from that day on you couldn't keep them apart
They were side by side, heart to heart
Mama cried as Billy slipped the ring on her hand
And when the baby was born she was crying again

Well, he worked real hard and put some money down
On a little old house at the edge of town
And that night as he held her he couldn't believe
That God had made a girl that he'd never ever leave

Lying on the floor with his coloring book

Said, I haven't done this since I was your age

Who never did dream
Of ever leaving southern Arizona
Or ever hearing wedding bells ring
Never had a lot of luck with the ladies  
But he sure had a lot of good working skills
Never cared 'bout climbing any ladders
He knew the way
In a small cafe found the will
He met Miss Bonnie
And a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months later
The feeling got strong enough
Didn't know to call it
So it must of have been love
Drove him up town for a diamond
That's when he started going 
Over the line
Working overtime
To give her things
Just to hear say, ""She don't deserve him""
Be he loves her and he just kept going

Overboard, over the limit, to afford
To give her her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her, where would he be?
See, it's not for him
She is his only need

Ring on her finger and one on the ladder
New promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron
Stayed at home and had the first of two children
My time did fly, babies grew up and moved away
Left them sitting on the front porch rocking
And Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn grey
Every once in a while you would see him get up 
And he'd head down town 
'Cause he heard about something she wanted 
And it just had to be found
Didn't matter how simple or how much

Running wild and free

You in the shadows

That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
She'll come back someday

I have learned to trust in you.
So many things you given...
Before I even asked you to.

Are sometimes far apart.

Can I cast my cares upon you?
Can you stand the heavy load?
Can I count on you to walk me, down that long and winding road?
If you promise me these simple things, I can guarantee...
You can always count on me.

And we were easy to convince

Will forgive me just this once

Both needing something from each other

There was a softness in her eyes

To chase the lightning from the sky

Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before 
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door 
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man

When I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruising the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said, ""I never knew you were a pickup man""

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
'Cause there's something women like about a pickup man

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

A bucket of rust or a brand new machine
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill

Hauling cars out to the coast.

I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea.

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday they'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain
Then they drift on down and ride to the sea again.

Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
An old man sittin' not 10 feet away
Just lost his wife and he said to me
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine
I guess the good Lord giveth and the good Lord taketh away
And we both wiped a teardrop from our face.

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are a part of the pleasure and part of the pain
'Til they drift on down and ride to the sea again.

In his beat up Pontiac.
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat.
He could see that she was frightened,
Standing out there in the snow.
Till he said ""I'm here to help you ma'am,
By the way, my name's Joe.""

She said, ""I'm from St. Louis"",
And I'm only passing through,
I must've seen a hundred cars go by,
This is awful nice of you.""

When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk,
And was about to drive away,
She said, ""How much do I owe you?""

Here's what he had to say:

You don't owe me a thing,
I've been there too.
And someone once helped me out,
Just the way I'm helping you.
If you really wanna pay me back,
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you.

Well a few miles down the road,
The lady saw a small cafe.
She went in to grab a bite to eat,
And then be on her way.
But she couldn't help but notice,
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along,
And dead on her feet.

No, she didn't know her story,
And she probably never will,
When the waitress went to get her change,
From a hundred dollar bill,
The lady slipped right out the door,
And on a napkin left a note.
There were tears in the waitress's eyes,
When she read what she wrote:

You don't owe me a thing,
I've been there too.
And someone once helped me out,
Just the way I'm helping you.
If you really wanna pay me back,
Here's what you do:

That night when she got home from work,
The waitress climbed into bed.
She was thinking 'bout the money,
And what the lady's note had said.

In the ways of the world.

On a summer night, running all the red lights.

We parked way out in a clearing in a grove,
And the night was as hot as a coal burning stove.
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green eyed girl had been a mother to be, for two weeks.
I was out of a job and she was in school,
And life was fast and the world was cruel,
We were young and wild, we decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets in the morning light,
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

We took one more trip around the sun,
But it was all make believe in the end,
No I can't say where she is today,

And there's no such thing as what might have been

That's just a back seat and some Muscadine wine
That's just auburn hair brushing 'cross my cheek
And those 'kiss me' green eyes smilin' back at me

But, I'll be fine once I get it rowed back in
I know sometimes I may act a little crazy

But that's just Jessie

An' sometimes in the evening, I hear barefeet in the hall
And I see your slender silhouette, dance across the wall
Then I catch the scent of jasmine perfume in the wind
And I know it's her sweet memory coming back again

Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-ton short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

Well, I used to rock all night long
To 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back

Down by the lake?

And we can try out the four-wheel drive

Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

'Cause it's a good night
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shore line

Catfish on a trot line

Crickets singin' in the background
And more stars that you can count on a night this clear

Is grab a sleepin' bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck

Probably wouldn't recognize me

She broke his heart; he spent his whole life tryin' to forget

Until the night

Both:
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees

Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree

Tellin' stories bout fishing or lessons learned

I borrowed my neighbor's Cadillac

All I wanna do is hold you close and steal a little
More time, is that such a crime?

Do I just need to give up and get on with my life

Ran away young and decided to roam

The water tastes good, the winters ain't cold
Home, where the trees grow tall
The home fires burn, the whippoorwills call

I remember stories that my daddy used to tell
My eyes would get big, and his chest would swell
I could sit for hours and listen with glee
As he'd tell of how he lived when he's a boy like me

He had three sons, three only ones, both Jack and Tom were sly
But Ted was honest as could be he would not tell a lie

The brothers tried to ruin Ted before the old man's eyes
At last the plot begin its work till Ted was much despised
The father then said ""Be gone you're heartless to the core""
Then the black's sheeps words they came just a ringing through the door

I know that I've been wayward but I won't be anymore

He called to them both Jack and Tom and gave them all his gold
I only need a little room, a place at your fireside
One night on Jacks' returning home he brought with him a bride

The three began to hate the father more and more each day
At last he heard the three declare why the old fool's in our way
They then agreed to send him to the poorhouse that was near
Then like a flash the black sheep's words came ringing in his ear

A wagon drives up to the door it is the poorhouse band
The brothers pointed to their dad, ""Right there is your man""
Then a manly form appeared came rushin' through the crowd
""Stop this you brutes"", the lad replied it shall not be allowed

You took the old man's property and all that he could save
You've even sold the little lot containing mother's grave
I am his son but not your kin from now till judgement day
The father clasped the black sheep's hand and they all heard him say

Don't be angry with me son, I know I drove you from my door

A deck of cards. During a North African campaign a bunch of soldier boys
Had been on a long hike, and they arrived in a little town called
Casino""

The next morning being Sunday several of the boys went to church. A
Sargent commanded the boys in church, and after the Chaplain had read the
Prayer the text was taken up next... Those of the boys who had a prayer book
Took them out, but this one boy only had a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out

The Sergeant saw the cards and said,""Soldier, put away those cards""

After the services were over the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sargent, why have you brought this man here?""

""For playing cards in church, sir""

""And what have you to say for yourself, son?""

""Much, sir."" replied the soldier

'The Marshall said, ""I hope so, for if not, I shall punish you more than
Any man was ever punished""

The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on a march for about six days, and I had neither Bible nor Prayer Book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions""

With that the boy started his story

""You see, Sir, when I look at the Ace it reminds me that there is but one God. The deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into two parts; the Old and New Testaments. And when I see the trey I think of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When I see the four I think of the four evangelist who preached the Gospel. There was Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And when I see the five it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps. Ten of 'em; five who were wise and were saved; five were foolish and were shut out. And when I see the six it
Reminds me that in six days God made this great heaven and earth. And when
I see the seven it reminds me that on the seventh day God rested from His
Great work. When I see the eight I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when he destroyed this earth. There was Noah, his wife, their three sons, and their wives. And when I see the nine I think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine of the ten didn't even thank Him. When I see the ten I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone. When I see the King it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I see the queen I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary who is Queen of Heaven. And the jacks, or knaves, it's the devil. And when I count the number of spots on a deck of cards I find three hundred sixty-five the number of days in a year. Fifty-two cards, the number of weeks in a year. Four suits, the number of weeks in a month. Twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year. Thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter.

Not many people know
So I'll tell you the story
Of a hobo and the rose

In our town a young man
Loved this lady fair
He gave to her a white rose
To wear in her hair
But she in turn gave to him
A rose that he would wear
To prove that their love was true
And that they'd always care

But her father was a rich man
The town respected him
Since the young man was a poor man's son
Their chance for love grew dim
Her father forced upon her
Another man to wed
And this put the young man
On the tracks so the people said

He became a hobo
In dirty ragged clothes
But upon the dirty clothes he wore
He wore this one white rose
He traveled far to many towns
In his life upon the tracks
But he never found another love
So he decided to come back

His sweetheart was still married
Her children numbered five
And trying to make her house a home
She forgot he was alive
Then one day she saw a crowd
Thank you for using Lyricsvault.net

Gathered by the railroad track
By the sign of the one white rose
She knew that he'd come back

There she saw a beaten man
In dirty ragged clothes
She only recognized him
By the one crushed white rose
They buried him in a poor man's grave
Out on Proper's Hill
With no one to mourn him
But the lonely whippoorwill

If you should pass his grave
On a warm summer's night
You'll see upon his grave
A rose so clear and white
 
This is my story always I suppose

There ain't no fun in this town

This town has got a lot of swinging doors but there ain't no fun in this town anymore
No there ain't no fun in this town anymore my mind is weary and my heart is sore
I will admit that I've had fun before but there ain't no fun in Houston anymore
This town is holding memories of mine about the girl who left me here behind
But memories are not worth staying for and there ain't no fun in this town anymore
There ain't no fun in this town anymore my mind is weary and my heart is sore
I will admit that I've had fun before but there ain't no fun in Detroit anymore
If anybody asks you why I'm gone just tell 'em that I stayed around too long
They can give what I got coming to the poor
Cause there ain't no fun in this town anymore

And visions of last year

With colors of crimson and gold

To the meadow where the meadow lark is singing in the tree 
In the meadow I go walking in the early morning breeze 
I cup my hands to catch a multi-colored butterfly 
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild 
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me

Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun 
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums 
Drops of morning due still linger on the iris leaves 
In the meadow where I'm walking in the early morning breeze

For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day 
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees

About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff

I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough

Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?

Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's... where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took another puff

I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway

When we analyzed the meaning
Of I love you and good-bye

Was the birth of a woman and a man

I was stealing corn from Homer Lawson's Field
The rattle of the cornstalks and the bark of Homer's hound dog
Made me hug the ground and lie dead still

Flashing through my mind was Big Homer's reputation
A man who really didn't give a damn
They say he shot ol' Mountain Joe for just one ear of corn
And laughed the day they laid him in the ground

Well I can hear the breaking of the sticks from someone's footsteps
But shaky legs just can't get up and run
And as I lay there breathless the next thing I expected
Was a blast of hell from Homer Lawson's gun

(Steel)
The clouds rolled by and then I saw the shadow of a lady
It was Homer's lovely daughter Julie Ann
I smelled the perfume in her hair as she sat down beside me
Whispered papa's running moonshine again

A lonely spot I know where no man may go
Where the shadows have all of the room

When a man came along, made me hush my song
Kicked me off away out there

And I climbed in an open door

"1667",182,"N/A","Marty Robbins","A long time ago in the small border town of Nogalas
There lived a beautiful Mexican girl named Ava Maria Morales
Her dark hair would glisten and shine when touched by the sun
And she loved a cowboy that told her he worked
ON a ranch just outside of Tucson

Diamonds he gave to her caused many people to say
How could he give her such diamonds as these on thirty a month cowboy pay
She paid no attention to what they said or what they did
'Cause she never doubted he worked on a ranch
Out of Tucson, just like he said

Then to Nogalas, one mormin', came ridin' a stranger
He wore a badge on the front of his vest, the new one in town was a Ranger
And he showed some pictures of outlaws and bandits he chased
And one of the pictures caused Ava Maria
To turn with fear on her face

Ava Maria
It's true what they said
Your cowboy's an outlaw
With a price on his head

The Ranger left town on the trail of the outlaws he hunted
Ava Maria prayed he'd never catch the cowboy she loved and she wanted
'Cause deep in her heart she believed that the Ranger was wrong
The outlaw just looked like the cowboy that worked
On the ranch just outside of Tucson

True love would never let Ava Maria believe it
And there in her window each evenin' she'd light
A candle and hoped he would see it
The years turned her dark hair to silver but love still lived on
She prayed every night for the cowboy that worked
On the ranch just outside of Tucson

One night the town of Nogalas was saddened to see
The window where Ava Maria would watch was dark where a light used to be
Some love stories live for a while and then they are gone
For over a century the story of Ava Maria has lived on and on

And a whole lot of lone
And more than a little bit crazy

To keep his belly still
And for each full hour lesson he gave
He got a crisp ten dollar bill

To a concrete castle king

Just to hear my children sing

And as the fire burned low and only a few glowing embers remained, we laid on our backs all warm in our sleeping bags and looked up at the stars. 

And as I felt myself falling into the vastness of the Universe, I thought about things, and places, and times. 

I thought about the time my grandma told me what to say when I saw the evening star. You know, Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight. I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.

The air is crystal-clear up here; that's why you can see a million stars. 

I remember a time a bunch of us were in a canyon of the Green River in Wyoming; it was a night like this. And we had our rafts pulled up on the bank an' turned over so we could sleep on 'em, and one of the guys from New York said, ""Hey! Look at the smog in the sky! Smog clear out here in the sticks!"" And somebody said, ""Hey, Joe, that's not smog; that's the Milky Way."" 

Joe had never seen the Milky Way. 

And we saw the Northern Lights once, in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. They're like flames from some prehistoric campfire, leaping and dancing in the sky and changing colors. Red to gold, and blue to violet... Aurora Borealis. It's like the equinox, the changing of the seasons. Summer to fall, young to old, then to now. And then tomorrow... 

And then everyone was asleep, except me. And as I saw the morning star come up over the mountains, I realized that life is just a collection of memories. And memories are like starlight: they go on forever.","Aurora Borealis","C.W. McCall's Greatest Hits",1978,12,204,12,"Album",0,7,1978,1970,201.47619047619,0.142857142857143,"3",66.6666666666667

When right out in front of the Baptist church
Come a big ol' purple school bus
Had astrological signs upon it
And thirty-five hippies and dogs inside
About half of 'em went for the courthouse lawn
And them dogs commenced on the fireplug
Rest of 'em set there starin' at us
And I says, ""Roy, go get your Flit gun""
He says, ""Which is the hippies? And which is the dogs?""
I says, ""Beats the hell outta me, Roy.""
What they was, was a bunch a' them Crispy Critters
And their leader was a space cadet 

He says, ""Sagittarius, we has arrived.
Prepare to disembark, men.
Get the incense goin' and the sitar out

I says, ""Boys, let me explain the situation to ya.
A: you're gettin' me down
And B: we got us a leash law here
And C: you in the wrong town.
You drop one string a' beads in that there park
And you gonna see a whole lotta stars.

Or we gonna blow ya ta Mars."" 

Well, they all got back in the purple bus
And proceeded to the city limits.
Then the telephone rang, was the swimmin' pool
Says a mess a' wild Critters was in it!
So we all got in the Marshal's Plymouth
(Which is always at the Conoco station)
Went flashin' on down to the swimmin' pool 
To give them Critters a citation 

By the time we arrived, it was too damn late
Them critters is all had their pants down
Them dogs was tearin' the bathhouse apart,
And they's after the fish in the fish pond!

""And I'll get the rest with a net.
We gonna have a jail full a' naked Crispy Critters 
And a drip-dry space cadet."" 

Well, we gave 'em hell, but we lost the war
'Cause them Critters outnumbered us
So they moved in and set up camp
And they lived in that purple school bus
Six weeks later, there was nothin' in town
But eighty-four dogs and a head shop
Sellin' dried up weeds, and sunflower seeds,
And astrological postcards 

Yeah, Critters took over the City Council

Well, we took up off'n the highway and we come upon a sign says ""Black Bear Road. You don't have to be crazy to drive this road, but it helps."" I says, ""RJ, this must the shortcut road Kubozke was talkin' about."" She didn't pay no mind, 'cause she was makin' peanut butter sandwiches for the kids in the back seat throwin' rocks and drinkin' Kool-Aid and playin' count-the-license-plates. But they wasn't havin' too much fun a-countin' license plate or cars, 'cause there weren't no other cars.

We went about a mile-and-a-half in about four hours, busted off the right front fender, tore a hole in the oil pan on a rock as big as a hall closet. Went over a bump and spilt the Kool-Aid and Roy Gene stuck his bolo knife right through the convertible top and the dog threw up all over the back seat. Peanut butter don't agree with him, you see.

So we had to stop and take off the top and air everything out and clean it up. The dog run off and RJ says she felt her asthma comin' on. I was sittin' there wonderin' what to do when the en-tire scenic San Joo-wan U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep car sank in the mud. At thirteen thousand feet above sea level.

Well, we shoveled it out and ate our lunch, the dog made a yellow hole in the snow and Roy Gene got out his Instamatic and took a snapshot of it. Mary Elizabeth drawed a picture of the road; it looked like a whole bunch a' Zs and Ws all strung together. And RJ took one look at it and said that the only way that Jeep car is goin' down that road is over her dead body. Then a rock slipped out from under the wheel and the U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep car went right over the edge of the cliff. Yahoo-ooh-ooh-ooh!

""Doggone-it, Roy Gene! How many times do I have to 'splain it to you? When I tell you to put a rock under the wheel, I mean rock! Now look at that, what you have there is no bigger'n a grapefruit.""","Black Bear Road","C.W.

On a wagon headin' west
And his mom and dad knew he'd grow up bad
By the mark of the devil on his chest

Seventeen he turned up mean
He had already made his bid
He had a name in the fast gun game
And they called him the ""Devil Kid""

Now the kid's name grew and his gun did too
When an old ghost town appeared
Sittin' there in the marshall's chair
Was the one they called ""Grey Beard""

""Kid, you better quit while the quittin's good
'Cause there's always one that's bigger
There'll be one guy with a faster eye
Who's lightning on the trigger

Let me tell you, son, about a real fast gun
That every outlaw feared
He made his name in this killin' game
He's the one they call ""Grey Beard""

He had a drawin' hand like no other man
It was faster than the eye
And there were always plenty of kids about twenty
Just couldn't wait to die

He was a fast gun
Lookin' to make a name
Quikin' was his virtue
Killin' was the game

So the kid said, ""Tell me,
Where is this man who never feared a gun?""
Grey Beard raised his head and said,
""Your looking at him, son.""

So the kid tried staring Grey Beard down
With eyes like ace up dice
And Grey Beard's frown turned upside down
To a smile as cold as ice

So the Devil Kid reached for his gun
With a draw as fast as light
But he lost the game from a shot that came
From somewhere out of sight

And as the kid went down and he hit the ground
Thought he had lost his mind
He heard Grey Beard snicker
""I was even quicker before I went stone blind""

Of a little run-down cabin in the woods
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.

When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.
We lived our day-today in plain dirt fashion,
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.

But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,
And somewhere in between I must have grown
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.
Now I know, it's a long hard road

Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,
When the sun-up came, we got up and went
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent
Singin' songs along with Gramma's radio.

Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack,
Livin' in my memories all in vain
'Cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.

Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.

My mother's lullaby that train that rain behind our home
A whippoorwill on a windowsill- It should have made me smile
But everything sounds lonely to a melancholy child

I thought I could outrun the emptiness inside of me
So I went a little crazy, and I went a little wild
Trying to outdistance my own melancholy child

I met a kind and gentle man who thinks the world of me
When he looks my way, it's a woman that he sees
But when I can't explain to him the tears that fill my eyes
He takes me in his arms and rocks his melancholy child

You take a black Irish temper and some solemn Cherokee
A Southern sense of humor and you got someone like me

He could make it cry, he could make it moan

In a smoky little tavern just off of Bourbon Street
Tobacco stained fingers waited on the down beat

With an army of six strings

Straight to the French Quarter there's a man he has to see
The music is a raging like a city that's on fire
Billy felt just like an altar boy at the feet of a higher power
Conley watched as Billy walked across the room
Opened his case and started a tune
The whole club was silent and the lights were turned down low
Billy stepped up on the stage and Conley whispered, ""Go son, go""

Conley held his hand up, no one made a sound
And he handed Bill his old archtop and stepped into the crowd
Billy played it soft, Billy played it sad
Then he made it talk and in came the band
Soon the room was shaking before Billy's wall of sound
And just a block off Bourbon Street, a new king's been crowned.

I was born in Oklahoma in 1969
My daddy played the honky tonks
Out on the county line
One night he took me with him
Through those swingin' doors
And I heard that country music
Saw that crowded dance floor
Dad made fifty dollars
And I stayed up 'til three
And I thought
This is the life for me

By the time I turned fourteen
I was pickin' lead guitar
Everyday I went to school
And at night I played the bars
Two or three years later
I noticed something strange
All the looks that I was gettin'
From the girls began to change
I knew right then and there
What I was gonna be
This is the life for me

This is the life
The only one I want to know
Everyday another town
And every night another show
Ever since I was a boy
I've had this crazy dream
Now I know it was meant to be
This is the life
This is the life for me

Well I tried to go to college 
Just to see if I was wrong
But that ain't the kind of knowledge
That helps you write a country song
I got my education on the wild side of life
Through a cloud of smoke so thick
That you could cut it with a knife
There was no doubt about it
As far as I could see
This is the life for me

This is the life

I was racin' time my mama said
I really covered some ground 'til you slowed me down
And took my life where angels fear to tread

Everywhere I go your hands are on the wheel

It takes a real man to take a backseat to a woman

You never push and you never pull

The way that he still got around
His station was still full-service, by gosh
And he fixed every car in this town

I stood in the door and saw nothin' had changed
That stubborn old son-of-a-gun
Not the clock on the wall, not the soda machine
Or the sign that said Miller And Son he said

The roof needed mending and the walls needed paint
But the stained glass still gave them a glow
I couldn't bear one more unanswered prayer
So I turned and I started to go

Then I heard a voice from the back of the room
That would make any sinner believe

Lookin' like a permanent fixture

Shootin' the bull in an old cowtown
Watching grass grow as the sun goes down
Better be careful were you take a step, keep one eye on the ground
Shootin' the bull in an old cowtown

Well I took a long gander at the high rise world
And life on the big city streets
It's folks talking on the corner and gabbing on the streets
When I think about it all well I'd much rather be

Shootin' the bull in an old cowtown
Watching grass grow as the sun goes down
While life goes by at a much slower pace
Than the speed of sound

We're just two people holding on tight
This night is young and this feeling strong
The smile on your face said it all

Love is Alive and well tonight
Taking control like a raging fire
Burning its way from your heart to mine

This world is empty and cold at times
But here in your arms I am warm inside
Beyond any feeling I've felt or believed
Bring on tomorrow, I can face anything

Five days a week in the same bus seat
For a girl she was pretty cool
She wore an old ball cap, hated lace
Made a mean short stop and second base
Never missed a day of Sunday school.
And I never told a soul back then
But Emily Harper was my best friend!

We carved our names on an old old limb
On the bank of the creek where we used to swim
A farmers son and a preachers only daughter
We ran bare foot throught the garden gate
All afternood we'd laugh and play
Till the sun went down on me and Emily Harper.

About the time I turned sixteen,
I noticed Emily's eyes were green
And how they shined when I made her laugh.
I liked it when her hair was down.
I hated other guys around.
I played it cool, but I had it bad.
Lord her daddy had a fit
When he caught me stealing my first kiss.

We carved a heart on that old old limb on the bank of the
Creek where we used to swim
A farmers son and a preachers only daughter
We used to sneak off in my daddy's car
Sit on the hood and count the stars
Till the sun came up on me and Emily Harper.

It all seemed just like yesterday
We grew up but some things never change
We still hold hands by that old old limb
On the bank of the creek where we used to swim
A farmers son and a preachers only daughter
We vowed to grow old side by side
Till the sun goes down on me and Emily Harper.

What a cruel way to remind me that you're gone.

Hand in hand, I thought they'd never stop
They played our song again and again

Like a sad armadillo across this desert I roam
I've been stripped down, bare, till I break
Still the wheel keeps turning

Had me a sweet one, I tell no lie
Summer nights in the cornfields, when the corn gets so high
We traveled clear across Wichita, headin' north
Leavin' civilization

And there were highways to get across
And places far from here
And I was his lonesome prairie
And he was my wild frontier

Harvested peaches in a small border town
Saved all our wages, put ten percent down
I never thought I'd see the world through a child's eyes
Until early December

Then one Calgary morning, still as glass
While my baby was sleeping, an angel slipped past
And with one breath said I'm taking him back
To his Father in Heaven

Through gravel and ice and new fallen snow
I held him through my tears
Because I was his lonesome prairie
And he was my wild frontier

This can't really be what life is all about
Learning how to live Just to live without
The travesty's the irony and the irony is you
I've traded in my sanctity for a cheaper shade of blue
And as I surrender to this sunken bed
So afflicted by the tenant in my head
Even now I wonder how you lay her down to sleep
When secretly I know it's my soul that you pray to keep
But will you really keep me

(Keep me)
On your porch, on your tongue
Beating in your chest, or coming undone
Folded neatly in the cover of your favorite book
(Keep me)
At a distance, in your maze
Fumbling through a contemplative haze (keep me)
Or tucked away clandestinely where no one else will look
Where my broken sky reaches to your velvet sea
Will you keep me

Drowning in the bottom of this empty glass
I pray god is good and that this too shall pass
Then from the abyss maybe I'll find a sweet reprieve
When the echo of your kiss reminds me to believe
That you'll always keep me

(Keep me)
Under god, or on your wall
Behind closed doors forever after all
Or headed south on the blacktop ribbon we designed
(Keep me)
The mantle of integrity, investing in
Something I'll never see (keep me)
At 30,000 feet or in the windows of your mind
In a corner of your heart under lock and key
Will you keep me

Has brought a lifelong sentence
Now living without your breath to fill
My lungs will be my penance

Say you'll always keep me

On the ocean crashing into you

Being lovers meant a stolen kiss and holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married but we were only ten so we'd have to wait
He said we'd never let our love run down like so many do these days

So we treat our love like a firefly, like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top; run like hell to show it off
Oh promises were made when we'd go walkin'; that's just me and Charlie talking

Charlie always said he'd like to leave here; turned eighteen and left our sleepy town 
Letters came and went and I kept waiting for Charlie to come back and bring the life he'd found
It's funny how time and distance change you. The road you take don't always lead you home

You can start a love with good intentions, and you look up and it's gone

So we treat our love like a firefly like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar and with holes in the top; run like hell to show it off

Diggin' ditches for the man
You can't be a guitar strummer
Cussin' that shovel in your hand

Took my paycheck to a pawn shop
Bought a silvertone guitar
Wrote a song about a beer joint
Went and played it in a bar

It's hard as hell out on this highway
But I'm still addicted to the show
When that crazy crowd calls out it keeps me
A gypsy driftin' down the road

Buses, trucks and lit up stages
Angel faces with no names
Stadium of savin' graces
Stand and singing with a flame

It's hard as hell out on this highway
But I'm still addicted to the show
When that crazy crowd calls out it keeps me
A gypsy driftin' down the road

I go on when I'm too tired to sleep
And I go on, sing when I can't speak

Hand of a fortune teller's song
Young love shaking the earth
Like a heart shot out of a gun

Lips like gravity, pull me under
Reckless weather on his breath
Smells like rain, hits like thunder
A storm is coming, I've got nothing left
So we run, yeah yeah yeah we run
Come undone like a string on a sweater
That you pull but you know better
But doing what you shouldn't's half the fun
So we run

Fire and laughter, fence posts flying
Feel the fever in the air
Can't remember what came before him
And what comes after I don't care

Hands are trembling, I swore I wouldn't
One more look and I'll give in
A hundred reasons why I shouldn't
But I lost my heart in wanting him to win

Come undone like a string on a sweater
Old enough and should know better
But doing what you shouldn't's half the fun

I got me a job doin' lawn mower repair. 
I met an army recruiter down at the Winn-Dixie. 
He said son you've no future, pack up and go with me.

Well the first place we landed was a base called Balad. 
They convoyed our asses to a 10 acre faub. 
With my boots and my cover and an old M-16, two bottle of water and a cold MRE.

Oh, you meet lots of new friends and you're sure to get paid. 
We'll show you the world and we'll teach you a trade. 
It's not a job, it's an adventure. 
Oh yes sir I got that, but you never told me I'd get my ass shot at.

The first night in combat we went on patrol. 
The ambushed our convoy and we chased the assholes. 
We found them all hidin' in the water ditches. 
Took aim and killed all them son of a bitches.

Walked in on my buddy with a female marine.
Ugliest woman that you've ever seen. 
He said why are you laughin', you've got lots of nerve. 
Over here in the desert, we grade on the curve.

Where they play George Strait and that's all

There are nights when I wake up and know that he's beside me I swear
Sometimes I still feel him there
