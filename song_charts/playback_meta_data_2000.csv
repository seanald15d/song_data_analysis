0,1,Lee Ann Womack,"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance..........

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin'
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance....I hope you dance
I hope you dance....I hope you dance
(Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
and wonder where those years have gone)

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,

2,3,Tim McGraw,"I think I'll take a moment to celebrate my age
The ending of an era, and the turning of a page
Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord, have mercy on my next thirty years

In my next thirty years
I'm gonna have some fun
Trying to forget about all the crazy things I've done
Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears
And I'll do it better in my next thirty years

In my next thirty years
I'm gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I'm doing here, in my next thirty years

Oh my next thirty years
I'm gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers, huh
Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years
Will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here

On the merry-go-round that we call life.
Take a drive on cruise control,
Then you wait to find it's a winding road.
I had my dreams in view,
When the money ran out and the engine blew.
Hung my tears out to dry,
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky.

And I, I was walkin' the clouds.
Feelin' so safe and sound.
Somethin' else knocks me down.

One fine day you wake up,
Completely, hoplessly fallin' in love.
He's just what you're lookin' for,
The only problem is, that the man's not sure.
Another guy'll give you everything,
The only problem is you don't feel a thing.
Well I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense.
Oh, one day you get what you want.
But it's not what you think.
Then you get what you need.

On the fifty yard line
You were always the perfect one

And I played my guitar too loud

When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
You never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into the money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world

He never comes home and you're always alone

That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny

Oh, and we sat there talking just like we were old friends
Oh, then I asked her, can I see you again

She said yes, and I said wow
She said when, and I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by just like a fast train
And nothing else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
Loving her is just like breathing
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me

Oh, then it happened one night, looking in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question, much to my surprise

She said yes, and I said wow

With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes

When you're going camping in the wild outdoors

Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette

I had big plans for our future,
Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise,
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle,
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start

Now some people think I'm a loser,
'Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner,
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember,
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along

I'd gave you a ring, and I promised you things
I always thought we'd do


But my best-laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you.
And if you could read my heart,
Then you'd know without exception

I said, ""You'll only get this back on one condition""

Never spoke of His Name
Never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life

And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunken rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad 
Kisses and hugs everyday

And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him

Here to drown him and forget him
So I set her up again to wash him down

He never missed a lick
Professing his neverending love
Oh, but I never will forget

So I guess you think we're just gonna kiss and make up, don't you
That's when she said

Why don't you kiss, kiss this
And I don't mean on my rosy red lips
Me and you, we're through
And there's only one thing left for you to do
You just come on over here one last time
Pucker up and close your eyes
And kiss this goodbye

Well, the next thing I recall
She had him back against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
And I mean right up in his face
Dragging him down a list of done-me-wrongs

Well, it was just about now
That the crowd gathered 'round
They've come to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun
And when we thought that she was done
She reared back and she let him have it again, man

Tell her that you want her to stay

Before I close my eyes
I look at my woman and

In his beat up Pontiac.
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat.
He could see that she was frightened,
Standing out there in the snow.
Till he said ""I'm here to help you ma'am,
By the way, my name's Joe.""

She said, ""I'm from St. Louis"",
And I'm only passing through,
I must've seen a hundred cars go by,
This is awful nice of you.""

When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk,
And was about to drive away,
She said, ""How much do I owe you?""

Here's what he had to say:

You don't owe me a thing,
I've been there too.
And someone once helped me out,
Just the way I'm helping you.
If you really wanna pay me back,
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you.

Well a few miles down the road,
The lady saw a small cafe.
She went in to grab a bite to eat,
And then be on her way.
But she couldn't help but notice,
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along,
And dead on her feet.

No, she didn't know her story,
And she probably never will,
When the waitress went to get her change,
From a hundred dollar bill,
The lady slipped right out the door,
And on a napkin left a note.
There were tears in the waitress's eyes,
When she read what she wrote:

You don't owe me a thing,
I've been there too.
And someone once helped me out,
Just the way I'm helping you.
If you really wanna pay me back,
Here's what you do:

That night when she got home from work,
The waitress climbed into bed.
She was thinking 'bout the money,
And what the lady's note had said.

In the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said son I know you live here
But this is still my home
It's my way or the highway
So I said all right I'm gone

And before I slammed that door
I said I hate u
He just shook his head
And said ok

But you can't stop my love for u
It'll be here that's a given
As long as I am livin' on this earth
One thing is true.
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name
But love will never let you go
Son my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowly turning on itself
But girl it took losing you
To finally know how bad it felt
We stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin' onto pride and anger
As we threw our love away

And before you slammed that door
U said I hate u
But tonightif you could only hear me say

U can't stop my love for u

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA

After graduation Mary-Ann went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And make-up to cover her bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away, Mary-Ann flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
That Earl had to die!

They tasted all right to me, Earl

Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said,
""Thank you, ladies, if you hear from him let us know""

Well, the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night
'Cause Earl had to die

And there I stood in another line
Trying to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me
Was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes

And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say

""Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight""

He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the Cashier said, ""Son, there's not enough here""
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said ""Mama made Christmas good at our house
""Though most years she just did without,
""Tell me, sir, what am I going to do,
""Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes""

So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out 
I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
""Mama's gonna look so great""

Was it me

Seems to be our baby girl I'm trying to raise
She's my life my morning angel
Always seems to find the rainbow after the rain
Lately she's so busy growin'
I don't even think she knows you've gone away

She finally learned to say goodbye
She's sleepin' through the night
She don't wake up cryin'
And she's walking on her own
She don't need no one holdin' to her hand
And I hate to admit she's stronger than I am

She ain't crackin' under pressure
First one step and then another she goes along
If she falls and skins her knee
She cries awhile and smiles at me and just goes on
So many things that she can teach me
Full of life and so completely innocent
She still says she loves her daddy
Goes on just like nothin' happened
Forgives and forgets

She's just like her old man

'Til you drift off to dream in my arms

Ten dollars worth of gas
She was obviously lost
But too afraid to ask directions

And a stick of beachnut gum
Said, ""Where you headed to girl?
Where you comin' from?""

She said, ""New Orleans

Then she stayed a week
A couple months later they were
Livin' on his parents' street
He worked the station
She worked the store
And then they had a baby
And then they had one more, little Jessie
When she dropped the kids off
At the mothers' day out
All the ladies had their questions
But knew not to ask about

New Orleans

At the first baptist church
A stranger standing in the doorway
As she's passing out dessert

'Cause I'm here to take you home
We're going back to Louisiana

There's a few defining moments
In every person's life
When you know what you've done wrong
And you know what you've done right

Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten

Hot on my feet

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA

After graduation Mary-Ann went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And make-up to cover her bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away, Mary-Ann flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
That Earl had to die!

They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said,
""Thank you, ladies, if you hear from him let us know""

Well, the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night

And then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
Is all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter
Down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad, hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up, fillin' their paper plates
And they've drove or flown in here from fifteen different states
Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
And all because two people fell in love

Yeah, there ain't nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love

Well, I recall a young man
Who was driftin' aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little café right off of 14th Avenue
With a whole lot of help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

And baby, there ain't nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be or ever was
I'm glad your dad could not resist
Your momma's charms and you exist
All because two people fell in love

You know to me it's all so clear
Everyone of us is here
All because two people fell in love

The thunder rolls

She runs back down the hallway
Through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror he won't do this again
'Cause tonight will be the last time

And the lightning strikes

870,N/A,Garth Brooks,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night

That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
