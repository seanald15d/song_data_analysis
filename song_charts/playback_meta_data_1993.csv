0,1,Alan Jackson,"Well, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
Never had a plan, just a-livin' for the minute

Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Ya ha

Well, we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
Never had a plan, just a livin' for the minute

Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was

1,2,John Michael Montgomery,"I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss.
The way that your fingers run through my hair,
And how your scent lingers even when you're not there.

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh,
And how you enjoy your two hour bath.
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane.

But I love the way you love me.
Strong and wild, slow and easy.
Heart and soul, so completely.
I love the way you love me.

I like to imitate ol' Jerry Lee
An' watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off-key.
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

But I love the way you love me.
Strong and wild, slow and easy.
Heart and soul, so completely.
I love the way you love me.

And I could list a million things I love to like about you,
But they all come down to one reason I could never live without you.

I might as well go on and set her free, she's already turned me loose. 
No fault, no blame, nobody done no wrong-

Sometimes two people just don't get along, it's time to hit the road.

Good luck, wish you well, take it slow. 
Easy come girl, easy go. 

We tried to work it out a hundred times, ninety- nine it didn't work.

No hard feelings darling, no regrets, 
No tears and no broken hearts.

7,8,Joe Diffie,"They were farm kids way down in Dixie 
Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour 
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night 
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene 
In John Deere green

They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard 
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night 
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene 
In John Deere green

Now more than once the town has discovered 
Painting over it ain't no use
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it
The heart keeps showing through

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night 
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the fool should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene 
In John Deere green

Ah, paint it green boy

On a hot summer night 
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""

Or settlin' down, would you marry me

I should've been a cowboy

I'll be off to find myself once again in Puerta No-One-Knows, when my ship comes in

I was waiting for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match had been tossed into my soul
It was like a dam had broken in my heart

Gettin' lost and losin' track
So that even if I wanted I could not find my way back
After driving out the memory
Of the way things might have been
After I'd forgotten all about us

We were rolling through the Rocky's
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along
And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love
And we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when

I guess something must have happened
And we must have said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why

Well, for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's past
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on earth you are

But that's just a lot of water

And there's no use in backtracking

Are just bound to rise again

A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night

That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been

The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion

You'll hear a beep and you know how to play this game
Leave your number and your name
And I promise I'll call back

Tears and champagne offer no solution
He'll say Soon to her forever
So she makes her New Year's resolution

She won't call him anymore
Soon
When he shows up at her door
And asks her When can I be with you again?
It'll be her turn to say

And felt the fire burning in my heart

And had never tasted love
So I took her by the hand
And a boy became a man

And once upon a lifetime
You hold the queen of hearts
But if you gamble on a diamond
When the dealing starts
You stand to lose it all
As the cards begins to fall
And the lesson learned is hard
You're only dealt the queen of hearts
Once upon a lifetime

So if your taking chances know the chance you take
A broken heart's a high price to pay
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise
And the best things seldom come along twice

Once upon a lifetime
You know that you've been blessed
When you hold your firstborn
Tenderly against your chest
And through the innocence you see
The value of a family
And you feel a special bond
That only comes a long
Once upon a lifetime

So if you taking chances know the chance you take
A broken heart's a high price to pay
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise
And the best things seldom come along twice

Of ever leaving southern Arizona

So it must of have been love
Drove him up town for a diamond

To give her things
Just to hear say, ""She don't deserve him""

To give her her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her, where would he be?
See, it's not for him
She is his only need

Stayed at home and had the first of two children

Left them sitting on the front porch rocking
And Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn grey

And he'd head down town

And a little bit of her was a little too much

Didn't know to call it
So it must of have been love
Drove him up town for a diamond

Just to hear say, ""She don't deserve him""
Be he loves her and he just kept going

To give her her things he knew she wanted

See, it's not for him
She is his only need

Stayed at home and had the first of two children

Left them sitting on the front porch rocking
And Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn grey

And he'd head down town

Well, I walked up on something like I'd never seen
So deep in the woods where I thought I was alone
Stood a structure where something or someone called home

I saw a shotgun and a guitar and a six-pack of beer
A sign on the front door said,""Guess, who lives here""
An old red bone hound that looked older than time
And an old man that's sure he was only twenty-nine

And I swear he looked just like ole Hank

Played coast to coast and a few foreign lands""

Somehow I hope, I let 'em know I loved them all""

I said, ""You're mighty skinny"", and he said,""Would you believe
That it only took one woman to do this to me?""

So she went to her mother's 
And I went for a drive

Down an old familiar highway 
Just a few miles out of town
To that run down, one room tavern 
That used to be my stompin' ground

Well I pulled in the driveway 
You know it all still looked the same
And I couldn't wait to down a few 
And hear that jukebox strain

But as I walked in through the doorway 
Well there stood some kind of matra'd
Well he looked me up and he looked me 
Down and said can I help you please

And I said what'd you do with those swingin' doors
And where's the sawdust on the floor
Why's everybody wearin' suits and ties
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes

And who's idea was it to hang these ferns
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song

Well I looked back to the corner 
Where the jukebox once stood proud
Some clown was playing records 
Too fast, too long and too loud

And it must have been a big mistake 
To try and speak my mind
So as they were asking me to leave 
I cried out one more time

What'd you do with those swingin' doors
And where's the sawdust on the floor
Why's everybody wearin' suits and ties
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes

And who's idea was it to hang these ferns
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song

Walk into the office
In your business suit
And matching shoes
With your hair pulled up neatly
You tug at your glasses
And you sit down
Just three desks down
And I watch you in the fluorescent glare
And my mind drifts away somewhere
And I see

You
In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind
You're a beautiful sight
I see you in a different light

When they walk by

To a stranger yesterday
When she turned around
I said ""I'm sorry"" and just walked away
From a distance she had that look
And for a second or two

Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on.
I'd be better off in a pine box,

And go to hell and face the devil,
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.

I always thought that someday,
We might get back together.

Come bring me to my knees

And there's no forgivin' me
Then don't say nothin',' just pick you up somethin'
