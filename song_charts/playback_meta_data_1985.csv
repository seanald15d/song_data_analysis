It's gonna take more then wakin' to rise me
I wake up with this need again

Had a flat on her stingray with nobody around
I helped her out, she said climb in
So I ditched my ol truck just to see where the party would end.

We spent the weekend in reno in the honeymoon suite,
Never saw the casino, barely took time to eat.
I never dreamed she would take me this far
But by Sunday that lady had taken a hold of my heart.

It's a modern day romance, a new kind of game
With no time to slow dance in the fast lane.
I tried to love her without any strings
But a modern day romance has left me some old-fashioned pain.

She never said good-bye, just a note by the phone
Said ""thanks for the good times, but it's time to move on.""

Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, 
Let me thank you for your time

Ringing up the sale
Or the one who fights the fires, 
The one who brings the mail
For everyone who works behind the scenes.

You can see them every morning 
In the factories and the fields
In the city streets and the quiet country towns
Working together like spokes inside a wheel
They keep this country turning around.

Bringing in the load
Or the waitress, the mechanic, 
The policeman on patrol

And all her crinolines were billowin' 
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore
And oh, what a joy fell on the honored guests
As each one of them was drawn into her dream
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands
And hollered at her, dance little Jean

And they said, dance little Jean. this day is for you
Two people you love stood up to say I do
Dance little Jean, a prayer that you had
Was answered today, your mama's marrying your dad

Well, my cynical heart just melted
'Cause I figured what this get-together meant
How it ended years of tears and sad confusion 
That little girl had spent
And they told the band to pack it up
About the time the couple cut the cake

Of a little run-down cabin in the woods
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.

When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.
We lived our day-today in plain dirt fashion,
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.

But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,
And somewhere in between I must have grown
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.
Now I know, it's a long hard road

Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,
When the sun-up came, we got up and went
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent
Singin' songs along with Gramma's radio.

Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack,
Livin' in my memories all in vain
'Cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.

Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where my name is known.

Now I'm gone, and it's a long hard road

A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams

And she's like a baby, just learning how to play.

She never thought that love could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon
When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday.

She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down.

'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch
But work took me a way from home late at nights
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust.
