And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?

Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her?

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun

I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartaches that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So, hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?

Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby

1,2,Jim Stafford,"I remember when Mary Lou 
Said, ""you want to walk me home from school?""
Well, I said, ""yes, I do""
She said, ""I don't have to go right home
And I'm the kind that likes to be alone some if you would""
I said, ""me, too""

And so we took a stroll
Wound up down by the swimming hole
And she said, ""do what you want to do""
I got silly and I found a frog
In the water by a hollow log
And I shook it at her and I said, ""this frog's for you""
She said

I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool, you fool
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you

Well, I think of that girl from time to time
I call her up when I got a dime
I say, ""hello, baby""
She says, ""ain't you cool""
I say, ""do you remember when?
And would you like to get together again?""
She says, ""I'll see you after school""

I was shy and so for a while
Most of my love was touch and smile
Till she said, ""come on over here""
I was nervous, as you might guess
Still looking for something to slip down her dress
And she said, ""let's make it perfectly clear""
She said 

I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool, you fool

Lord, don't she make me proud

Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me

I can tell you've never been this far before

I don't know what I'm saying
As my trembling fingers touch forbidden places
I only know that I have waited
For so long for the chance that we are taking
I don't know and I don't care
What made you tell him you don't love him anymore
And as I taste your tender kisses
I can tell you've never been this far before

Well, I'm not a man appointed judge
To bear ill-will and hold a grudge
But I think it's time I said me a few choice words
All about that demon automobile
A metal box with the polyglass wheel
The end result to a dream of Henry Ford
Well I've got a car that's mine alone
That me and the finance company own
A ready-made pile of manufactured grief
And if I ain't out of gas in the pouring rain

And wires and tires and anti freeze
And them accessories

Well you can get a stereo tape and a color TV
Get a back-seat bar and reclining seats
And just pay once a month, like you do your rent

Costs fourteen thousand dollars
And ninety-nine cents, well now

Lord Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see
What your simple horseless carriage has become
Well it seems your contribution to man
To say the least, got a little out of hand
Well Lord Mr. Ford what have you done

Now the average American father and mother
Own one whole car and half another
And I bet that half a car is a
Trick to buy, don't you
But the thing that amazes me, I guess
Is the way we measure a man's success
By the kind of automobile he can afford to buy

Right turn, no turn, must turn, stop
Get out the credit card honey, we're out of gas

Would reach to the moon and back again

And faintly through his clenched teeth he called momma's name

He said ""girl you're young

But you can't steal no will and mind
'Cause momma's always lookin' for a lover""

In search of what her life was all about

And an ole suitcase full of hand me downs

Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
With the softest golden curls you've ever seen.

But then one day, he met this pretty lady
And she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your mommy sad
'Cause, oh, what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far away

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries.

Then it came to pass, the King grew lonely
And the pretty lady wasn't all she seemed
He realized that he was wrong
And started his long journey home
For he misses little Princess and his Queen.

Then he was back and safe inside his castle
And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain
Then the castle rang with laughter
They lived happy ever after
Knowin' he would never leave again.

The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.

If fate should pull back the blind
How would my wife feel if she could see
The woman in the back of my mind?

Does she do things fancy, does she have a family?
Is she as happy as I?
Does she spend her afternoons just playing bridge
Or baking her children a pie?

And I often wonder if she thinks of me
When she hears those old church bell's chime
Though it's been long ago at times I miss her so

For ever' man that puts in

Always got somebody lookin' down his neck

Than he really ought to have to put in.

After twenty-nine long years of workin'
In this shop with Oney standin' over me ...
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire ...

The superintendent just dropped by and said
They'd planned my little get together ...
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire.

I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the mornin' feelin' tired ...
And old Oney don't remember, when I came here
How he tried to get me fired ...
With his folded hands behind him
Every mornin' Oney waited at the gate ...
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clockin' in five minutes late.

But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen 'em do when any man retires
Then old Oney's gonna tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire ...

And today about four-thirty
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost ...

As the workin' man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
Cause today I show old Oney who's the boss.

And moving does more than the same thing for me
Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers say movin' is a closest thing to being free
Willy rosins his riggins laid back his wages he's dead cert on ridin' the big rodeo
My woman's tight with an overdue baby and Willy keeps yelling hey Gypsy let's go
Willy you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther ready rolled from the same makins as me
Well I reckon we're gonna ramble till hell freeze us over
Willy the wandering Gypsy and me

Now ladies we surely will take up your favors
And we'll surely warn you there never will be
A single soul living that could put brand or handle
On Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
Well dance on the mountains shout in the canyons
Swarm it ain't loose herd like a wild buffalo
Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles and tellin' us stuff that we already know
Willy you're wild...
Yeah Willy you're wild...", Willy The Wandering Gypsy And Me,You Ask Me To,1973,2,2:30,Track 'B',Single,False
