0,1,Taylor Swift,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is somethin' wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again

I've heard every hour and listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home
For I said, ""Hey, man!""
Askin' God if he
Could play it again
Play it again

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song",,,,,,,,
1,2,Kenny Chesney,"Couldn't wait to turn 16 and drive all the boy's around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
Five-hundred dollars it was mine, all mine and I never wanted nothin' more

I took Katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool hopin' she'd let me cross the line
I was praying that she couldn't tell I hadn't been that far before
The first time's a one time feelin' and I never wanted nothin' more,
No I never wanted nothin' more...

Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I'd thought it through
Katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say ""I do""
A little ring is a little thing, but it's all I could afford
Now she's mine, all mine till the day I die, and I never wanted nothin' more

Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

One Sunday I listened to the preacher and I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it I walked up front and I got down on my knees
Right then and there, I swear I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, good God almighty I never wanted nothin' more

Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

Never wanted nothin' more...

2,3,Rodney Atkins,"Driving through town just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy
Till his nuggets were gone
Green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my breaks and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a flying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with ""s"" and I was concerned
So I said son now now where did you learn to talk like that

He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you

We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said lord please help me help my stupid self
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my son's scooby doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to god like he was talking to a friend
And I said son now where'd you learn to pray like that

He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mama's hand
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you

With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said my little bear is growing up
He said but when I'm big I'll still know what to do

'Cause I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
By then I'll be as strong as superman

3,4,Kenny Chesney,"I turned on the evenin' news
Saw an old man being interviewed
Turnin' a hundred and two today
They asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his ol' pipe
Laughed and said, 'All I can say is'

Don't blink
Just like that
You're six years old and you take a nap
And you wake up and you're twenty-five
And your high school sweetheart becomes your wife 
Don't blink

Turnin' into moms and dads

Your better half of fifty years is there in bed
And you're prayin' God takes you instead

I was glued to my TV
When it looked like he looked at me
And said, 'Let's start puttin' first things first'
'Cause when your hourglass runs outta sand
You can't flip it over, start again

4,5,Brad Paisley,"She's a yellow pair of running shoes, an' a holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses, she looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate, take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear, now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof, with her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land, and a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation, that I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad, and she's a, lover when she's loving

And she's, everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her I go on and on and on
'Cause she's, everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town, and a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck, and a cuss word 'cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles, baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine, and she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be, and the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet, of my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding, when I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer, and she's the song that I'm playing

And she's, everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her I go on and on and on
'Cause she's, everything to me

She's the voice I love to hear, and someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair, I want rocking right beside me
Every day that passes, I only love her more
Yeah she's the one, that I'd lay down my own life for

5,6,Carrie Underwood,"Yeah, yeah
What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just want to give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing
Is just a grain of sand
And what you've been out there searching for forever
Is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide 
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking about what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count, 'cause you can't get it back 

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing

Things nobody knows, not even your friends
Take me there
Tell me about your mama, your daddy, your hometown, show me around
I want see it all, don't leave anything out

I want to know everything about you then
And I want to go down every road you've been

Where you keep the rest of your life hid

Take me there

Your first real kiss, your first true love
You were scared

And I've been layin' here prayin'
Prayin' she won't call
It's just another call from home and you'll get it and be gone and I'll be cryin'

And I'll be beggin' you baby
Beg you not to leave
But I'll be left here waitin'
My heart on my sleeve
Oh for the next time we'll be here seems like a million years and I think I'm dyin'

What do I have to do to make you see
She can't love you like me

Why don't you stay
I'm down on my knees
I'm so tired of bein' lonely
Don't I give you what you need
When she calls you to go
There is one thing you should know
We don't have to live this way
Baby, why don't you stay

You keep tellin' me baby
There will come a time
When you will leave her arms
And forever be in mine
But I don't think that's the truth
And I don't like bein' used and I'm tired of waitin'

It's too much pain to have to bare
To love a man you have to share

Why don't you stay

I've given you my best
Why does she get the best of you

So next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine

8,9,Carrie Underwood,"Standing at the back door she tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hard wood, it fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away 
And you just can't get it back let's face it

For one split second she almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops back into a cloud
So she took another step and said 
I see the way out and I'm gonna take it

I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by wasted

Another glass of whiskey, but it still don't kill the pain
He stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it

'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting
To wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spending no more time wasted

She kept driving along till the moon and the sun
Were floating side by side

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly, the kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Don't worry babe, I've got your back
And I've also got your front

Would like to take you home

So I dug for some change
Wouldn't need it anyway

Would care at all

I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery

You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

So I don't get hurt

Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you

I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes

I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh

My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

I heard you cry

You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry
In the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

And to this day he still wont speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline
I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck
When she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

If I had a dime
For half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all
I'd be living a little higher on the hog

That later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd've changed a lot of things
Startin' with me

I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks 'round here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell
And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standin' by the bed
When the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma die

Needs their faces in a magazine

Wear your yellow shades

My father had skin like leather
Hands like steel
From a lifetime spent in the cottonfields
Though hed come home tired and dirty
Almost everynight
He found the strength to smile at me and hold my mama tight
While that old transister radio would play the opry out in the hall
Id sit and watch their shadows glide across the wall

And theyd dance to a dixie lullaby
Picture of love beneath the southern sky
Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby

I left home at 18
In a hand me down chevrolet
Packed my mamas goodness and my old man's stubborn ways
It was college, work, and love
Then the babies came
The youngest ones got his grandaddy's name
And in the early morning hours when my children could not sleep.
I'd rock them in my arms to a simple beat

And id sing them a dixie lullaby
Hush baby don't you start to cry
Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby

My father was a mountain of a man
That was the description that I gave
The morning that we laid him in his grave
There with my mama by his side, we said our last goodbye
To a man we thought would never die
As I stood there in the fields of amazing grace
Oh how the tears ran down my face.

And I sang him a dixie lullaby
Well meet again, by and by
Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby

It was just a matter of time
This town is just too small for
Us to really say goodbye
You're smiling that smile that
You get when you're nervous
Like you don't quite know what to do
But this is me you're talking to
This is me you're talking to

I've heard you met somebody
It didn't take you very long
And I'll admit it isn't easy
Knowing you've moved on
But I can see how you could make any woman
Fall deep in love with you
This is me you're talking to

Me, the one who really knows you
Me, the one whose heart you've broken
Me, the one who was still hopin'
You might be missing me

We don't have to do this
We don't have to act like friends
As much as I would love to
I really just don't think I can
You don't have to tell me that you really love me
After all we have been through
'Cause this is me you're talking to

The more that they stay the same

I could start right now and we shook hands
He said the fence needs fixin',
The peaches need pickin'
And the cows need bringin' round

I was cussin' out loud, thinkin' bout quitin'
Lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't
'Cause just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter

She was just gettin' home from Panama city
She was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
When her eyes met mine
I was thinkin' that I would sure love my job
As the days got shorter our talks got longer
The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
So we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up
Every chance we got

We were down by the river all night long
When the sun came up I was sneakin' her home
And draggin my butt to work
With the smell of her perfume on my shirt
I'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind
With that sun beatin' down on this back of mine
Just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmer's daughter

We got married last spring
Whoa and there ain't no better life for me

I'm still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun has me sweatin' like a dog
So I cool off in the creek
And she brings me out a glass of sweet ice tea

A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while

There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes

Rushing headlong in the wind

Turn to velvet in a touch

While a thousand more, go unspoken for

And no matter what you do, it's still the same thing
But it's not the world, that I am changing
I do this so this world will know, that it will not change me

This heart still believes, that love and mercy still exist
While all the hatreds rage, and so many say 
That love is all but pointless, in madness such as this 
It's like trying to stop a fire, with the moisture from a kiss

With white headstones

To see the good things on my table
And for that I'm grateful

Outweighted the bad

Me and Becky didn't waste no time, went zero to 65 one night
Being young was getting old, we were heading down a dead end road
But we didn't care, we were on a roll. Hanging on for the ride
Those lines that we were crossing, carelessly tossing caution to the wind,
Were wearing thin.

We were living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

She loved me.

I think we thought that it would last, but looking back I had to laugh
What a mess we made of that, now I'm not sure that I would want it back
We learned a little bit about love, what it wasn't and what it was
It was fast and it was fun, the beginning of the end of us

One day that road just ran out, but I still travel down it now and then
And once again...

There's a melancholy in his eyes, for all of you who care enough to wonder why
Let me tell you
It all started back in 1957 when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
That's the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years too soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April 4th, Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now there's more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why, might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December 1980, no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year, to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why, he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes

But he's still goin'
There's a melancholy in his eyes, for all of you who care enough to wonder why
Let me tell you
It all started back in 1957 when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
That's the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years too soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April 4th, Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now there's more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why, might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December 1980, no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year, to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why, he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes
Then he told me
I've seen so much in my life I've never questioned, this time the good Lord took me by surprise

But he's still goin'
There's a melancholy in his eyes, for all of you who care enough to wonder why
Let me tell you
It all started back in 1957 when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
That's the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years too soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April 4th, Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now there's more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why, might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December 1980, no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year, to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why, he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes

John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me.

The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

Well now, I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.
(And he'd say.)

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said, don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.

Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas.

Learned to drink Sangria
'Til the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo.

Ah, but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came runnin' down the hall
Wearin nothin'
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero.
(And he was yellin',)

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.

And I said
We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the boarder guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash.
(He said.)
Doin' a little funny business
In Mexico, Amigo.

But all I could think about
Was savin' my own tail
When he mentioned ten years
In a Mexican jail
So I pointed to John Roy and said
It's all his now please let me go
Well, it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed.
(When you said,)

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck

From the mirror for luck
Said don't you know

Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign-car-driving dude
With a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone

He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and warm breeze is blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

I circled the parking lot
Trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar
Was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up

But from out of nowhere a Mercedez Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

Some beach, somewhere 
There's nowhere to go when you've got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot senoritas
Smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

Well, I sat in that waiting room
Seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said Doc's ready for you
Your not gonna feel a thing
We'll give you some novacaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two

But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

Some bridges burned
But there were
Lessons learned

There's mistakes that I have made
Some chances I just threw away
Some roads I never should've taken
Been some signs I didn't see
Hearts that I hurt needlessly
Some wounds that I wish I could have one more chance to mend
But it don't make no difference
The past can't be rewritten
You get the life you're given
Oh

From every day I wondered how I'd get through the night
From every change life has thrown me

Are all the things that make you strong

And you gotta just move on

About best friends.

John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me.

The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

Well now, I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.
(And he'd say.)

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said, don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.

Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas.

Learned to drink Sangria
'Til the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo.

Ah, but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came runnin' down the hall
Wearin nothin'
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero.
(And he was yellin',)

Said don't you know
All those little

Want playboys of the southwestern world.

And I said
We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the boarder guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash.
(He said.)
Doin' a little funny business
In Mexico, Amigo.

But all I could think about
Was savin' my own tail
When he mentioned ten years
In a Mexican jail
So I pointed to John Roy and said
It's all his now please let me go
Well, it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed.

So we'd make bets
On how much drink a guy could hold
And I held my own
Learn to hold my own

Daddy works some dead-end job at the concrete plant
Mama taught the Sunday bible class
For eighteen years I remember thinkin'
There was more to life than that
So I ran the streets to beat the Devil
Goin' just as fast as I could fly
'Cause I came here to live
I didn't come here to die

Mama used to wait for me with the porch light on
Worried about her little boy 'til I got home
Daddy he'd say listen son
But back then there wasn't much
That I didn't already know

I reckon I was doing close to 80
When I felt the tire slip out from under me
And I never set out lookin' for Jesus
So I guess Jesus come lookin' for me
And He found me upset down in a ditch
Smokin' gas in my eyes
And He said son you came here to live
You didn't come here to die

Sunday morning I got up and I went to church
That summer I got a job and I went to work
Met a girl in town put some money down
On a little house with a yard

Our little boy was due in September
But he came early in July
For eighteen days all I remember
Was settin' there at his side

Just open up your eyes

1049,N/A,Josh Gracin,"We headed out to California
Everybody tried to warn us
Said we wouldn't make it any further
Than that worn out Chevy would

We broke down a time or two
Thought ""maybe we didn't think it through""
We were all we had to turn to
When it wasn't lookin' good

We're lookin' back laughin'
'Cause they called us crazy

We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly - had to get away
Took a chance on that feelin' - baby
We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we weren't crazy

Just a couple kids a couple years ago
Now we gotta couple kids of our own
We turn out right - proved them wrong
Look at us goin' strong

Lookin' back laughin'
'Cause they called us crazy

We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly - had to get away
Took a chance on that feelin' - baby
We were lovin' blind - borderline reckless
We were livin' for the minute we were spinnin' in
Maybe we were a lot of things
But we weren't crazy

Coulda set it down
When things got tough
Coulda walked away from this love
But that'd been crazy

We were young, we were wild, we were restless
Had to go, had to fly, had to get away

When I walk into the room.
And just the other night,
Why did you stop dancing,
When I caught you in the kitchen with the broom?

A part of you, you still keep all to yourself
When I'm around.


Sometimes I wish I was invisible, baby
And stand in the doorway, you're drivin' me crazy,
With every simple natural thing that you do.

Sometimes I wish that I could disappear
So baby without you knowin' I'm here,
I could fall in love all over again with the way that you move.

'Cause when you're all alone
And you don't know that I'm watchin',
You're so beautiful.
Sometimes I wish I was invisible.


I'd go crazy every mornin'
Just seein' you put up your hair.
Then I'd ride shotgun with you all the way to work,
Just to watch you walkin' when you got there.

Baby I'd love to see all those things you keep from me
When I'm not around.

As you rolled down our drive,
Without one single tear in your eyes.
I tried to be strong,
Forced a smile, said girl go on,
I'll be fine don't you worry 'bout me.
But inside I was holdin' on,
Prayin' that you might see I'm all you'll ever need.


How do I hurt?
And how do I cry,
When so many times you let me down?
Where do I turn?
And where do I hide,
With all this emptiness inside?
There's no use in lovin' you at all,
So let me fall.


I try to make it through the day,
I'm throwin' all your things away, yeah,
The ones that remind me of you.
But soon there'll be nothin' left,
But the bed where you laid your head,
The one that I wake up in, without you.

1052,N/A,Josh Gracin,"I know you said when I left,
I'd regret every word, every breath,
Every step, every minute without you.
Go do what you have to.

I know I said you were wrong, I'd move on
It was only a matter of time till I'd make it without you.
But this wasn't about you.

I said I needed space,
A change of place,
To go out and live my life.
But,


I don't wanna live without you anymore,
And what I wouldn't give to get us back to the way it was before.
I admit I was wrong all along,
Now you're gone with all that I'd been living for.
I don't wanna live without you anymore.


For a couple of nights I was fine,
I was high on the wine and the lights
And my new found freedom
That I thought I needed

But that cold lonely room that I headed home to,
It felt like a tomb.
I just stared at the ceiling,
What an empty feeling.

And, baby, I apologize,
And tell me it's not too late.

Yeah, sometime away from day to day to get ya.
Needed some kind of break,
Like a hammock in the shade.

I've got this spot where it don't get much better.
Yeah, it's cold, it gets hot; I don't worry 'bout the weather.
My private paradise don't fit the classifieds.
Vacation at my side every day and every night.

Hawaii's got big breaks; Michigan, Great Lakes;
Colorado snowflakes, Georgia peaches.
Louisiana hot food, New York attitude, Florida beaches.
Tennessee whiskey; Baby, are you with me?
Texas chili, Virginia pine.
It's hard to beat that California sunshine.
Baby, you're my favorite,
Favorite state of mind.

It feels just like I've died and gone to Heaven.
Your lips, your eyes, hell everything gets me revvin'.
You're fearless and you're fun; thirty flavors all in one.

1054,N/A,Josh Gracin,"When I was nineteen, I threw my stuff in the car,
Headed up to the Rockies, took a job at this bar
Sellin' beer to the locals, and just barely getting by
On the tips from the rich kids, there on daddy's dime.
But from the moment she walked in one night,
I knew that I'd be all right in

Telluride, snow fallin' down,
I was wakin' up in that sleepy little town.
In her eyes my world came so alive,
I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride.

We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire
Castin' shadows on the cabin wall, drownin' in desire.
Confessin' all our secrets and laughin' out loud,
So high up on that mountain,
I thought we'd never come down
It was a dream we were livin' in,
And I was the happiest I'd ever been in

Telluride, snow fallin' down,
Wakin' up with her in that sleepy little town.
In her eyes my world was so alive,
I never will forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride.

It ended just like a movie scene,
And I had to play the part
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave
And me with the frozen heart

In Telluride, snow fallin' down,
Standin' there alone in that sleepy little town.
In her eyes my world came so alive,
I never will forget the day she said goodbye,

Telluride, snow fallin' down,
I was wakin' up in that sleepy little town.

Are on the windshield melting along.
The sound of perfect harmony
Are in the background, sweet emotion.

We were young and free in my Cherokee, scared to death.
You had your head leaned back
Your toes on the glass, watermelon red.


I remember what song was playin', that it was rainin',
The time, the day, the month, the year
The sweat, the steam, the urge, the fear
There's nothin' about that long wet, sweet Semtember,
I don't remember.


I smile and wonder where you are,
And if you ever think of me.
And how after that night in my arms,
We were never meant to be.

Yeah, we lived and learned, the pages turned, no regrets,
First time someone makes you feel like that, you'll never forget.

What I do what I don't.
I won't change your mind anyway.
Say I'm flyin' too high,
Crossin' too many lines,
I'll just crash and burn up in flames.
I got too much to do for just one life,
And baby I can sleep when I die.


I'm only breathin only feelin' on this planet so long
So I'm livin' it up, livin' it up.
I got my ticket, gonna kick it like a Rollin' Stone.
So I'm livin' it up, livin' it up.
Livin' it up, livin' it up now.


Straight ahead full speed on a one way street,
I ain't stoppin', I ain't slowin' down.
I wanna empty my tank,
Leave nothin' left in the bank,
When they lay me in the ground.
I wanna a front row seat, I wanna rock all night,
Cause baby I can sleep when I die.



I wanna take it, make it, evey day don't wanna waste it,
Love it, touch it, squeeze it, taste it,
You can't take it with you when you go.
