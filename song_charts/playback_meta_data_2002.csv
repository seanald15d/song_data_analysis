0,1,Steve Holy,"Good morning beautiful how was your night
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I opened my eyes and see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
Well since you came along
I can face the dawn
'Cause I know you'll be there

Good morning beautiful how was your night
Mine was wonderful with you by my side
And when I opened my eyes and see your sweet face
It's a good morning beautiful day

I never worry if it's raining outside
Cause in here with you girl the sun always shines

1,2,Kid Rock,"Kid Rock:
Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sun shine in three damn days
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

Sheryl Crow:
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waitin' on you for a long time
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

Sheryl Crow:
I saw you yesterday with an old friend
Kid Rock:
It was the same ole same ""how have you been?""
Both:
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

Kid Rock:
You reminded me of brighter days
Sheryl Crow:
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church
Kid Rock:
I was off to drink you away

Both:
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home

2,3,Kenny Chesney,"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around 'til I saw the neon lights
The corner bar
It just seemed right, so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end, an' lookin' half asleep
But he walked up and said ""What'll it be?""
I said, ""The good stuff""
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kinda went misty
He said, ""You can't find that here

'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date
Mama's all worried when you get home late
And droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin' so much
And it's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
An' eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff""

He grabbed a carton of milk 
And he poured a glass
Then I smiled and said
""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said, ""That's my Bonnie, taken 'bout a year after we wed""
He said, ""Spent five years in the bottle, when the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holdin' my  baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt sayin' 'I'm a grandpa'
Bein' right there as her time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man, that's the good stuff""

He said, ""When you get home she'll start to cry
When she says, 'I'm sorry,' say 'So am I'
Look into those eyes so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause thats the good stuff
That's the good stuff""",,,,,,,,

Yeah, I wanna feel the sun shine,
Shinin' down on me and you!
When you put your arms around me,
You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do.

I used to run in circles goin' no where fast.
I'd take, uh, one step forward and two steps back.
I couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to, mmm, mmm.
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you.

Whoa here we go now!

Yeah, I wanna feel the sun shine,
Shinin' down on me and you! Whoa!
When you put your arms around me,
Well, baby there ain't nothing in this world I can't do.

Sometimes it's hard for me to understand,
But you're teachin' me to be a better man.
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do, no, no.
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you.

I'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you. Ooh.

5,6,Toby Keith,"Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my list of things to do today:
Go to the bank and the hardware store,
Put a new lock on the cellar door.
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done,
But when the sun is settled, there's still more than a few things left
I haven't got to yet.

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Wouldn't change the course of fate,
Cuttin' the grass just had to wait
'Cause I've got more important things
Like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow, what I could get done today

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer,
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Raise a little hell, laugh till it hurts,
Put an extra five in the plate at church,
Call up my folks just to chat,
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, and over sleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Tell me what you got on your mind
I guess those college boys all went home for the summertime
And you're lookin' right, lookin' good, lookin' like a woman should

Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside,
Stretch Armstrong

I was Roger Staubach back in my back yard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evil Kinevil scars
On my right arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried

It was 1970-something
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Faucett hair-do days
Bell bottoms and 8-track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1970-something

It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
Dad broke down and finally shaved
Them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubix cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A Space Shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1980-something

Another day has almost come and gone
Can't imagine what else could go wrong
Sometimes I'd like to hide away
Somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost
But not the war

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

It's almost like the hard times circle 'round
A couple drops
And they all start comin' down
Yeah I might feel defeated
And I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing
But I'm not dead
No

'Cause tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

Ooh

No I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
And I'm not gonna lose any sleep

And I am not afraid

9,10,Alan Jackson,"It was painted red the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

When Daddy let me drive

Daddy let me drive

Oh he let me drive

It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson
And electric choke",,,,,,,,

And a thousand red sunsets

And I revealed to her my two left feet.
Said, Don't get me wrong I'm glad you asked
But tonight's about me and an old memory.

I let her lead me out on the floor
And after four rounds with Jose Cuervo
I was showin' off moves never seen before.

Well, around five or round six
I forgot what I came to forget.
After round seven or was it eight
I bought a round for the whole dang place!

After nine rounds with Jose Cuervo

Give our love a chance (just one more chance)

And if we walked away
Would It make more sense

A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and there's gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white and blue

Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you'll be sorry that you messed with the U. S. of A.
'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way

Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list

20,21,Martina McBride,"I get kissed by the sun each morning
Put my feet on a hardwood floor
I get to hear my children laughing
Down the hall through the bedroom door
Sometimes I sit on my front porch swing
Just soaking up the day
I think to myself, I think to myself
This world is a beautiful place

I have been blessed
And I feel like I've found my way
I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day
I have been blessed
With so much more than I deserve
To be here with the ones that love me
To love them so much it hurts
I have been blessed

Across a crowded room,
I know you know what I'm thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we're lying in the quiet and
No words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift

When I, when I'm singing my kids to sleep
When I feel you holding me
I know",,,,,,,,
21,22,Chris Cagle,"Lately I've been runnin' into our old friends
Somewhere in the small talk
Someone always asks where you've been
So I tell 'em what you told me
And they can't believe we're through
They ask me what I'm doing now
And in case you're wondering too

I breathe in, I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out.

Now I've got every reason
To find someone new
Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turnin' round
And my heart believes that you're gone

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Till you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Yes we were meant to be
Girl there's no doubt
And if it takes the rest of my life
For you to figure it out

I'll breathe in and breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, Oh, I'll breathe in, and breathe out","I Breathe In, I Breathe Out",Best Of Chris Cagle,2010,15,,Track '4',Compilation,True
22,23,Tim McGraw,"If I lived and breathed before you loved me, I don't recall
If I walked around at all
It was in bits and pieces of a jagged heart
You kissed me and every piece went back in place
Every pain got erased
You held me up to the sunlight
Now it feels like,

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
I never got lost,
Spent years in the dark
You're here now my heart's unbroken
When I see you smile,
Feel my soul again
And I'm unbroken

If I doubted the power of love,
Baby, now I understand
I thank God for every day I wake up
To the soft touch of your magic hands
In this world sometimes the only thing that's real
Is the way you make me feel
Babe, the change is day and night
I swear it's life

No one ever left me out in the rain
Cold words still remain unspoken
I never got lost,
Spent years in the dark
You're here now my heart's unbroken
When I see you smile,
Feel my soul again
And I'm unbroken

I still see the night I fell into your eyes
And when we made love, it felt like the first time.",,,,,,,,
23,24,Blake Shelton,"My brother said that I was rotten to the core.
I was the youngest child so I got by with more.
I guess she was tired by the time I came along.
She'd laugh until she cried I could do no wrong.
She would always save me because I was her baby.

I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the Bayou,
I drove a truck in Birmingham. I Turned 21 in Cincinnati,
I called home to mom and daddy, I said Your boy is now a man.
She said I don't care if you're 80, you'll always be my baby.

She loved that photograph of our whole family.
She'd always point us out for all her friends to see.
That's Greg he's doing great, he really loves his job.
Ronnie with his 2 kids, how 'bout that wife he's got.
And that one's kinda crazy, but that one is my baby.

I got a call in Alabama, said come on home to Louisiana 
And come as fast as you can fly.
'Cause your momma really needs you, and says she's got to see you, 
She might not make it through the night.
The whole way I drove 80, so she could see her baby.

She looked like she was sleepin' and my family had been weepin' 
By the time that I got to her side.
And I knew that she'd been taken and my heart it was breakin', 
I never got to say goodbye.

I softly kissed that lady and cried just like a baby...",The Baby,The Dreamer,2003,10,,Track '2',Album,True

Here's what I tell everyone
I was born by God's dear grace
In an extraordinary place

Hard work pays off the way it should
Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

There's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

28,29,Kenny Chesney,"Lookin' back now, well it makes me laugh,
We were growin' our hair,
We were cuttin' class,
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn,
We were strikin' matches just to watch 'em burn.

Listen to our music just a little too loud,
We were hangin' in there with the outcast crowd,
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,
It was a long train trestle but we had no fear,

Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that,
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll t-shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young

Talked a good game, when we were out with the guys
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy,
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain,
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change

Man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll teeshirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly

29,30,Joe Nichols,"My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm
Way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts
With a quick turn of his wrench
He pulled splinters from his hand
Never even flinched

In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that grandpa died, I realized

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable 
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year 
Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch
They brought the helicopter in
And Billy couldn't feel his legs
Said he'd never walk again

But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
And the day we graduated, he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable 
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

So don't tell me that it's over

With a sign sayin' ""will work for food""

Wondering when the lights going to turn green

There's alot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony

On TV at 3 AM
I'd never guessed that at midnight Tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl

There's only one thing I'm sure of right now

I should be sleeping

These late hours I've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though I'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still I know I
Should be sleeping

I never knew that I was funny
Till I went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and I liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like I'll be up for a while

After just three dates
And one great kiss
It's way too soon

Get away and get out on my own
And looking back now
Ain't it funny how
I've been trying to get back home

When my low self-esteem needs a man-loving me
And I find me a perfect catch

And I don't wanna be quite so attached

And I know there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by 
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

I've sold what I could and packed what I couldn't

We were just about as wild as we were green,
In the ways of the world.
Well she picked me up in that red rag top,
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops,
On a summer night, running all the red lights.

We parked way out in a clearing in a grove,
And the night was as hot as a coal burning stove.
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green eyed girl had been a mother to be, for two weeks.
I was out of a job and she was in school,
And life was fast and the world was cruel,
We were young and wild, we decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets in the morning light,
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun,
But it was all make believe in the end,
No I can't say where she is today,
I can't remember who I was back then.

And there's no such thing as what might have been

To my cousin up in Tennessee 
Oh, and he brought down a blue tick hound 
She was pretty as she could be 
Well they penned her up in the swampland 
'Bout a mile just south of the gate 
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
I'd just drop him off and wait

And waited till the time got right

And I smiled when I heard 'em turn Red out

My reckless ways and I almost did
But somehow I lost track and wound up giving in
To the late night life and the good time friends

That Julie's future sure was looking bright

Well I saw her selling videos
At a store in Eastland Mall
I said why aren't you in Hollywood
Taking casting calls
And she handed me my change
And started laughing

And said... Life Happened
Me and Bobby Chaplain fell in love
Daddy passed away and the babies came
And drama school was just too much
Now there's little league and mouths to feed
And I directed the kindergarten christmas pageant
Life happened

Curtis had an old Chevelle
The cops knew that car well
He never lost a race on Windy Hollow road
By the time he turned eighteen
He was a georgia dirt track king
Proudly sponsored by the local Texaco
I bumped into him at Murphy's bar
And he ordered us a round
I said why aren't you in Rockingham
Chasing Gordon down
He killed his drink
And tore the corners off his napkin

And said... Life happened
I was driving home from Athens
Late one night
A trucker fell asleep and swapped paint with me
Said I rolled that 'velle at least five times
Now I thank my stars and I sell used cars
And I teach drivers education at St. Catherine's
Yeah life happened

I saw the rest of my old friends
At our reunion at the Holiday Inn
And it seemed like it was only yesterday
Standing in the gym in our cap and gown
Full of wonderlust and glory bound
We set out to chase our dreams on wings of passion
But somewhere along the way we got distracted
Life happened
Our clothes went out of fashion with our songs
We started families and bought SUV's
Became step dads and soccer moms
I finally realized we turned all right
And we spent the night just catching up and dancing
And life happened",Life Happened,Life Happened,2002,11,4:25,Track '7',Album,True

It was not what you wanted
Now the walls say your name
And the pictures are haunted.

Does my ring burn your finger?
Did my love weigh you down?
Was a promise too much to keep around?

I remember your words
And I can't keep from crying
I could never believe
That your kisses were lying

Was there something from the past
Buried in a shallow grave?
Did you think that it was too far gone to save?

Please tell me baby
Please tell me now
You say that I should just go on
Now please tell me how

Now its just me and the night
And I'm so broken hearted
I just wait in the dark here

Up and off to work again,
Going through the motions
I bet she tried to warn me
And I didn't even notice
Till I got home and found her gone
Left with just a letter
Folded with a key on top
Sitting on the dresser
I opened it
It simply read

Look and you will find me
I won't be that far
I'll be right here waiting
For you with open arms
I don't want to live without you
But I can't go on like this
Torn between the man I love
And the one I'm living with
It's a conflict of emotion
To my heart I must be true
I know that I need you
But, you have to need me too
So if you get home and miss me in your life
You'll find me

I called her family
Asked everyone who knows her
Telling them in detail all the things
I should have told her
How much she really means to me
And how much I'm regretting
But so far no one's heard from her
And all that I am left with
Is how I let her go
And the letter she wrote saying
You'll find me

I spent the next eight hours wondering
Where on earth you were
It was getting late, I was getting tired
And growing more concerned
When all at once it hit me,
That piano bar back home
Where I asked you to marry me
And there you were alone

2nd Chorus
I knew I would find you
And how it warmed my heart
To see you right there waiting
For me with open arms
Said I don't know where I'm going,
But I can't go on like this
The thought of life without you
Is something I just can't live with
It's a conflict of emotion
To my heart I must be true
You told me that you need me

John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me.

The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

Well now, I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said, don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.

Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas.

Learned to drink Sangria
'Til the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo.

Ah, but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came runnin' down the hall
Wearin nothin'
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero.

We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the boarder guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash.

In Mexico, Amigo.

In a Mexican jail

And the lightning strikes
Another love grows cold
On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on
Out of control
Deep in her heart
The thunder rolls

Through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror he won't do this again
'Cause tonight will be the last time
She'll wonder where he's been

325,N/A,Garth Brooks,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night

That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes

821,N/A,Kevin Denney,"I don't know why he liked the
Water
He'd never seen the ocean before
But he was young and thirsty for
Adventure
And our country was at war
The poster in the window
Promised a chance to see the
World
And he figured that he had a
Score to settle
For the boys that died at pearl

He's proud and so am i
That he went and did his part
And I love to hear the stories
That he tells
Of typhoons, tattoos, geisha girls
And battles he's been in
Okinawa, iwo jima, and saipan
And for the longest time
He wouldn't drive a car made in
Japan
Daddy was a navy man

Says it was just his duty
That's why he volunteered
And when you're seventeen years
Old
You're just too dumb to be scared
And there's a friend he talks
About
He says he'll see again someday
'Cause you know old sailors
Never die
They just sail away

My daddy was a navy man",Daddy Was A Navy Man,Kevin Denney,2001,11,3:51,Track '11',Album,False
