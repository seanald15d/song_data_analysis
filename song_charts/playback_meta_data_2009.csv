0,1,Lady Antebellum,"Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone, 'cause I can't fight it any more
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Another shot o' whiskey, can't stop lookin' at the door
Wishing you'd come sweepin' in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now 
And I don't know how I can do without; I just need you now

Whoa-oh-whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothin' at all

We can go to the show or we can stay right here and

I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster

Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

I said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fire flies are dancing and the moon comes out

2,3,Darius Rucker,"He didn't have to wake up
He'd been up all night
Lying there in bed and listening

And when he drops her off at pre-school
She's clinging to his leg

This'll only last a week or two""

And at times, he'll think she hates him
And he'll walk her down the aisle
And raise her veil 
But right now she's up and cryin'
And the truth is that he don't mind
As he kisses her goodnight
And she says her prayers

He lays down there beside her
'Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart

You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later in the front porch light
Taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn’t told you yet, but I thought I loved you then

And I just can’t believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been
We’ve come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then

I remember, taking you back to right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There people around but I didn’t care
I got down on one knee right there

Maine, Alabama and Panama

There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

Yeah we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Getting to know everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

Oh, We went out last night

Were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

We talked about Gods grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the old man say,
""God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy""

He said ""I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damn if I know""
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death

He said ""These damn things will kill me yet,
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

He left his fortune to

Teacher's pet or child prodigy
I wasn't gonna get rich throwing a football
It'd take too long to get a law degree

So I sat down with Mama and Daddy
They tried to talk some sense into my thick head
But the best advice that I ever got
Was from my sister's rock star boyfriend

Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies, start a band
Start a band, start a band

Now all those girls that were too cool to talk to
They'll be waiting in a line out back
Might get your picture in the hometown paper
Maybe buy your mama that Cadillac

Just get you a guitar and learn how to play
Cut up some jeans, come up with a name
When you're living in a world that you don't understand
Find a few good buddies and start a band
Start a band
Scrape up some money, buy a van
Learn ""Free Bird"" and ""Ramblin' Man""
Never buy another beer again

So get you a guitar and learn how to play
Grow out your hair, come up with a name
With a little bit of luck you'll be packing the stands
Well, find a few good buddies, start a band
No need to study, start a band

And wonder why that I slowly die inside

Right at the Georgia line 
And I count the days
And the miles back home to you

A day might come you'll realize
That if you see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me

Margaritas in the moonlight (woah)

I remember thinking how cool it would be
When we were goin' on an eight hour drive
If I could just watch TV

To have my own Pac-Man game at home

And now I've got it on my phone

He fought against the Japanese
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma
Mailed them from his base in the Philippines

With a company in Tokyo

Happening right in front of me

Running back on the football team
They burned a cross in his front yard
For asking out the homecoming queen
I thought about him today

I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts and straighten the tracks

When she's gone the world goes dark

But boy she's hell on the heart

Once you feel her touch and you've felt that rush
It's gonna mess up your head
But here's the kicker son
Your old ticker's gonna beat you half to death

She's as pretty as a picture
Every bit as funny as she is smart

Sitin' here alone tonight thinkin' 'bout a lot of things
What's a man to say when all the questions start
Hell, I know deep down inside my broken heart

Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And given you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay 
And I'd've lost you anyway

I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now
Nothing I can say to you, you'd even care to talk about
How you gonna dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know

Kissed you just a little bit sweeter

This is where it all goes down
This is what ""I don't love you"" feels like
It ain't the middle of the night

On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light

Something 'bout that couple kids and crossing the street
Or something about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said ""It's over"", didn't try to lie or pick a fight
I might have seen it coming that way

But at a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town

I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots
Beside those high dollar shoes and Armani suits

When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A court house clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children grandmothers' maiden name
Yes it may not sound like much
But that's where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barley nineteen
Just a kid, chasing my dreams

And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family an my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The trucks are ford and the tractors green
And amazing grace is what we'd sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
Yeah it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your bother and did I mention
That Italian suits haven't always been my style?
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63
And my wife well she still my home coming queen

Had a cool little place where we'd go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Somebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do ""Ramblin' Man"", ""Proud Mary"", and ""American Band""
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs always the love songs

There was always a line that stuck in your head 
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin' of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin' songs we could do 'em all night long
But the ones we remember most

It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside

Made you wanna love the one you were with

I'm gonna marry for money 
I'll be so damn rich it ain't funny 
I'm gonna have me a trust fund, yacht club, hot tub piece of the pie 
Find me a sweet sugar mama 
With a whole lot of zeros and commas 
Don't really care if she loves me 
She can even be ugly 
I'm gonna marry for money 

I won't have to love her family 
I won't have to like her friends 
And if it works out like I planned it
I won't ever have to work again 

I'm gonna marry for money 
I'll be so damn rich it ain't funny 
I'm gonna have me a trust fund, yacht club, hot tub piece of the pie 
Find me a sweet sugar mama 
With a whole lot of zeros and commas 
I don't care if she loves me 
She can even be ugly 
I'm gonna marry for money 

Show me the money 

Cha-ching 

Y'all I'm gonna find a wife 
On a Lear jet the old lady buys me 
I'll call her sweetheart and honey if she's a hundred and twenty 
I'm gonna marry for money
I dont care if she loves me 
She can be really ugly 
I'm gonna marry for money 

Oh, cha-ching 
Mucho dinero

94,95,Jason Michael Carroll,"He's been sitting by the phone since she left
But it's time for work, and he just can't be late
So he grabs his old guitar
And he plays a couple bars on the machine
And then he softly sings

""It doesn't matter what you've done, I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been, you can still come home
And honey, if it's you, we've got a lot of making up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone, so hurry home""

Well, the message light was blinkin' when he got back
It was an old friend calling 'cause he just heard the news
He says, ""Man, I hope you find her
If I see her I'll remind her that her dad is worried
And wantin' her to know

It doesn't matter what you've done, I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been, you can still come home
And honey, if it's you, we've got a lot of making up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone, so hurry home""

Well, the days dragged by without a word from her
And it looked like she might not be coming back
People said, ""Man, don't you think it's time to take that old message off
He said, ""No, you never know when she might call""

She was just outside a bar in New York City
Her so-called friends had left her all alone
She was scared he wouldn't want her
But she dialed up that old number and let it ring
And then she heard him sing

""It doesn't matter what you've done, I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been, you can still come home
And honey if it's you, we've got a lot of making up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone, so hurry home""

A pick up truck when I could drive
One pink line when Katie said I'm late

All the money in the world
What mattered then kept changing every day

But when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids, please Lord
That's all I ask for any more

Nowadays it's crazy how
A passing storm, a siren sound
Can make me drop it all and pick up the phone
To hear her say that all's okay 
Is all I need to know these days
Can't wait to see their faces when I get home

And when I bow my head tonight
There'll be no me, myself and I
Just watch my wife and kids, please Lord

Let their laughter dry up all their tears
Let 'em love and be loved back like I have been

On the hard flat Kansas ground.
And a sad song in her head,
Kept blowin' round.

She barely even knew his name,
But she liked the way he played the game.
Everybody cheered, 
When he scored that last touchdown...

Indian Summer,
The wonder,
The hunger,
And the sound of distant thunder.
Indian Summer.

Tangled in a moment of truth.
Bottle of wine in a motel room
Blue haze circled 'round
The cold gray moon.

While the wind chased the leaves outside.
Passion found a place to hide.
Late September heat,
Couldn't be denied.

Oh Indian Summer,
The wonder,
The hunger,
And the sound of distant thunder.
Indian Summer.

She never even finished school.
People like to talk, they can be so cruel.
Heard California was a place,
To start brand new.

So she left that dust bowl town.
Sometimes when a long wind howls
I wonder where we'd be,
If I never scored that last
Touchdown.

That takes us to another place and time

About best friends.

John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me.

The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

Well now, I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.
(And he'd say.)

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said, don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.

Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas.

Learned to drink Sangria
'Til the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo.

Ah, but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came runnin' down the hall
Wearin nothin'
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero.
(And he was yellin',)

Said don't you know

Want playboys of the southwestern world.

And I said
We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the boarder guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash.
(He said.)
Doin' a little funny business
In Mexico, Amigo.

But all I could think about
Was savin' my own tail
When he mentioned ten years
In a Mexican jail
So I pointed to John Roy and said
It's all his now please let me go
Well, it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed.

I wouldn't see the morning sun
And there were days that seemed so dark
I couldn't wait for night to come
I couldn't stand to think about how
My life used to be
And how without a single warning
It all slipped away from me

Like a fool I thought I could fight
The shadows on my own
To the dark I was no stranger
This was stronger than I'd known
And by the time I knew that I was too deep I'd gone too far
And the light that used to guide me
Had faded from my heart
And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go
Surrounded by strangers I was so far away from home
And I don't know how you found me
All I know is I owe you everything
Yes I do

And I thank you for my heart
I thank you for my life
And I thank god for grace and mercy
And that you became my wife
I'm seeing for the first time
The stars, the sun and moon
But they've got nothing on the power
Of this love I have for you
And I thank you, I thank you

Now people say they'll never stand beside you
They swear they'll never leave
But when the rain started falling
You know it only fell on me
And it was hard to keep believing in myself
When all I felt was so much pain and guilt and shame
I couldn't even ask for help
I don't know if I believe in other lives
But when you came
There was something so familiar
About the way you said my name
And the whole world started turning
And I swear that I'd been born again brand new
And it's all because of you

On our family tree

In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.

Tired of this tired old tie I got on
Sick of this traffic jam that I'm in,

When I've had it up to here I go down there.

To guitars, and tiki bars, and a whole lotta love,
Mangos and marley you know, fit me like a glove.

It's guitars, tiki bars, and a whole lotta love.

I feel like a fish jerked out of the sea,
Or a bird in a cage that's never seen a key,
Sick of this grind and I think that I ought
To bring this grind to a grinding hault.

You could drown in your eyes of blue.
You were friend of a friend and someone, I'm glad I knew.

I'll always see you dancing, up there on the bow
Living life in the moment, happy on the hey now.
And you'll live with us as long as, memories stay alive,
And you left us with so many, Kristi
You will never die... never die...
You will never die... never die...

I hope time can be our healer, maybe time can be a friend,
Still I'm a strong believer, someday we'll see you again,
Where the sun is on our faces and the wind is at our back,
Sailing south to our favorite places, where the water's calm and flat.

Our circle of friends, we're sad that you're gone,
We celebrate your life with stories and a song.

In the cover's fold

It said mom I wish I could wave a wand
And make you smile again
Bring back the man who stole your heart
'Fore the demons got to him
If I stay here any longer
Something sacreds gonna die
He said mom I love you, Goodbye

Took a lot of wrong turns on the road
Finding his life
By the grace of God he ended up
With a little boy and a wife
And the phone call came from his sister
It was that old familiar pain
His mother was at the doorstep
Of heaven's pure white light

At the end of the service
His father came up to him
Clear eyed and sober now he said
Boy Jesus took my sins
And I pray someday maybe you'll forgive me too
With tears in his eyes
He said son I love you, Goodbye

His plane touched down in Texas
He pulled out his phone
Dialed in the number, got the machine
Of his old man's home
He said dad we got an extra room
And your grandson has your eyes
Couldn't say anything else

And he choked out dad I love you, Goodbye",Love You Goodbye,Southern Voice,2009,12,4:34,Track '12',Album,False

I wouldn't see the morning sun
And there were days that seemed so dark
I couldn't wait for night to come
I couldn't stand to think about how
My life used to be
And how without a single warning
It all slipped away from me

Like a fool I thought I could fight
The shadows on my own
To the dark I was no stranger
This was stronger than I'd known
And by the time I knew that I was too deep I'd gone too far
And the light that used to guide me
Had faded from my heart
And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go
Surrounded by strangers I was so far away from home
And I don't know how you found me
All I know is I owe you everything
Yes I do

And I thank you for my heart
I thank you for my life
And I thank god for grace and mercy
And that you became my wife
I'm seeing for the first time
The stars, the sun and moon
But they've got nothing on the power
Of this love I have for you
And I thank you, I thank you

Now people say they'll never stand beside you
They swear they'll never leave

You know it only fell on me
And it was hard to keep believing in myself
When all I felt was so much pain and guilt and shame
I couldn't even ask for help
I don't know if I believe in other lives

There was something so familiar
About the way you said my name

I thank you for my life
And I thank god for grace and mercy
And that you became my wife

And we no longer dye the gray out of our hair,
Sit and laugh and talk about all the things that we went through,
I look forward to lookin' back with you.

And Kyle rides with her to their high school,
It wont be long until they've both gone off to college,
Baby, I look forward to lookin' back with you.

When my new truck is my old truck,
And I take off these big ol' tyres,
And it's out turn to slow down traffic everywhere,
Spend our winters in a motorhome parked down in Cancun,
Yeah I look forward to lookin' back with you.

Ooh if our maker calls and takes me,
And leaves you here alone,
Don't be sad because I'm not that far away,
Once again hand in hand we'll walk the far side of the moon,

But it's time for work, and he just can't be late
So he grabs his old guitar
And he plays a couple bars on the machine
And then he softly sings

""It doesn't matter what you've done, I still love you
It doesn't matter where you've been, you can still come home
And honey, if it's you, we've got a lot of making up to do
And I can't hug you on the phone, so hurry home""

Well, the message light was blinkin' when he got back
It was an old friend calling 'cause he just heard the news
He says, ""Man, I hope you find her
If I see her I'll remind her that her dad is worried
And wantin' her to know

Well, the days dragged by without a word from her
And it looked like she might not be coming back
People said, ""Man, don't you think it's time to take that old message off
He said, ""No, you never know when she might call""

She was just outside a bar in New York City
Her so-called friends had left her all alone
She was scared he wouldn't want her
But she dialed up that old number and let it ring
And then she heard him sing

""It doesn't matter what you've done, I still love you

'Cause when all you got is that 8 o'clock, night night dad I miss you a lot
I stop in my tracks, I try to act strong when she calls

Now it's her Dr. Seuss and me and she's learning how to read
And I can't see those pictures, but I can hear those pages turn
And her mother says it bath time, as she blows a kiss through the line
I don't know what's worse saying goodbye, or talking to her
'Cause I'm the one that should be there tucking her in the bed
But since her voice is all I have I'm thankful for what I get

You could see it written in his eyes
As the train rolled out of sight, bye-bye

Never carrying the weight
You gotta let it down, let it go
Listen to me as I say
Never carrying that weight
Never carrying that weight
You gotta let it go",Be Somebody,My Best Days,2010,10,,Track '9',Album,False
1080,N/A,Danny Gokey,"Sometimes the road just ends
Changes everything you've been
And all that's left to be
Is empty, broken, lonely, hopin'

I'm supposed to be strong
I'm supposed to find a way to carry on

I don't want to feel better
I don't want to not remember
I will always see your face in the shadows of this haunted place
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky, but I will not say goodbye

They keep saying time will heal
But the pain just gets more real
The sun comes up each day
Finds me waiting, fading, hating, praying

If I can keep on holding on
Maybe I can keep my heart from knowing that you're gone

I don't want to feel better
I don't want to not remember
I will always see your face in the shadows of this haunted place
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky, but I will not say goodbye

I will curse, I will pray, I'll relive every day, I will shoulder the blame
I will shout out your name
I will laugh, I will cry, shake my fist at the sky, but I will not say
Will not say goodbye
(Goodbye)

Will not say goodbye
(Goodbye)
Will not say",I Will Not Say Goodbye,My Best Days,2010,10,,Track '10',Album,False
