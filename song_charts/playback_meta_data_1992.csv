Well, there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down
They got whiskey, women, music and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scoot boogie

I got a good job, I worked hard for my money
When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way

Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do, come on, baby, let's go boot scootin!
Oh, Cadillac, black jack, baby meet me out back - we're gonna boogie
Oh, get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie

I want a shot at that red-head yonder lookin' at me

But that was years ago
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder
But where she's now, I don't know

There's somethin' 'bout this time of year
That spins my head around
Takes me back and makes me wonder
What she's doin' now

'Cause what she's doin' now is tearin' me apart
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows
And I wonder if she knows, what she's doin' now

Just for laughs, I dialed her old number
But no one knew her name
Hung up the phone, sat there and wondered
If she'd ever done the same

I take a walk in the evening wind
To clear my head somehow
But tonight I lie here thinkin'

2,3,Collin Raye,"I read a note my grandma wrote back in 1923
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me
He said, ""Boy you might not understand, but a long, long time ago
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your grandma so

We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together
Get married in the first town we came to and live forever
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
I found this letter, and this is what it said

If you get there before I do, don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through; I don't know how long I'll be
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling, wait and see
And between now and then, 'til I see you again, I'll be loving you
Love, me

I read those words just hours before my grandma passed away
In the doorway of a church where me and grandpa stopped to pray
I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years
But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears

If you get there before I do, don't give up on me
I'll meet you when my chores are through; I don't know how long I'll be
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling, wait and see

11,12,Wynonna Judd,"Billy was a small town loner
Who never did dream
Of ever leaving southern Arizona
Or ever hearing wedding bells ring
Never had a lot of luck with the ladies  
But he sure had a lot of good working skills
Never cared 'bout climbing any ladders
He knew the way
In a small cafe found the will
He met Miss Bonnie
And a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months later
The feeling got strong enough
Didn't know to call it
So it must of have been love
Drove him up town for a diamond
That's when he started going 
Over the line
Working overtime
To give her things
Just to hear say, ""She don't deserve him""
Be he loves her and he just kept going

Overboard, over the limit, to afford
To give her her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her, where would he be?
See, it's not for him
She is his only need

Ring on her finger and one on the ladder
New promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron
Stayed at home and had the first of two children
My time did fly, babies grew up and moved away
Left them sitting on the front porch rocking
And Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn grey
Every once in a while you would see him get up 
And he'd head down town 
'Cause he heard about something she wanted 
And it just had to be found
Didn't matter how simple or how much
It was love, boy ain't that love just something
When it's strong enough to keep a man going

Over the line
Working over time
To give her things 
Just to hear her say ""She don't deseve him""
But he loved her and he just kept going

Over the limit to afford
To give her things he knew she wanted

That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
The whole world turns blue

Cross the railroad tracks

Way in the back

I spend most every night
Beneath the light

You in the shadows

I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
She'll come back someday

To the land of his dreams and just to have a look around
He parked his car at the courthouse square

And Jim's Drugstore was a tanning salon
He asked an old man, ""Where's ev'rybody gone?""
He found them out at the shopping center
Where Highway 1 meets Interstate 20

The country boys weren't wearing overalls
They were wearing suits made of camouflage
Southern belles talking like ""Valley Girls""

To the land of his dreams and just to have a look around

'Cause he didn't see any orange groves

Now, trailer parks and condos
Grew on the land that he once knew
He saw the city limits sign
And guessed he'd crossed the city line

There were strangers everywhere he went
With loud sport shirts and strange accents
They took the north and they moved it south
He said, ""Shut my redneck mouth!""

To look up stars he used to know

So, he thought he'd get some barbecue
At a little place that he once knew

And dealerships for foreign cars
And buildings that reached for the sky

It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""
She said just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy
Don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now, don't let me down, now,
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown""

Well, that was the last time I saw my Mama
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
Wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do
And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy,

It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pourin' his tea

I charmed a king, a congressman,
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out

Opened his case and started a tune

And he handed Bill his old archtop and stepped into the crowd

I said long live the king of Dixie

There was a man from Montgomery, lonesome to the bone
He only stayed a while, this world was not his home
It seemed like on behalf of broken hearts he's sing
And with every word he was calling my name

Now he's from Alabama where he first saw the light
There ain't a heart in heaven gonna cheat on him tonight
I can see him now, decked out in white
Sending down the word that everything's all right

The king of Dixie, he's still around
The king of Dixie, in every town
The king of Dixie, no he ain't gone
The king of Dixie's still on the throne
The king of Dixie, tried and true
Still rockin' away for me and you
The king of Dixie is you know who
I said long live the king of Dixie

The king of Dixie, he's still around
The king of Dixie, in every town
The king of Dixie, no he ain't gone
The king of Dixie's still on the throne
The king of Dixie, tried and true
Still rockin' away for me and you
The king of Dixie is you know who

When I was a baby, my sweet momma told me
Go around this world and see all that you can see
Find a good woman, get a job and settle down
But I could not stay away from the lights of town 
I had to go where the music is loud
I fell in with the honky tonk crowd

So let the jukebox play, let's dance all night
When you get down on the floor you know you've got it right
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
Well, I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd

There's was debutante in Dallas, that nearly blew my mind
She was raised on caviar and real fine wine
She didn't like hillbilly music and that was more than I could take
I left that lovely little cowgirl waiting in the Lonestar state
'Cause I had to go where the music is loud
I'm right at home with the honky tonk crowd

So let the jukebox play, let's dance all night
When you get down on the floor you know you've got it right
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
Well, I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd
Where there's a neon light, that's where I'll be found
'Cause I feel right at home with the honky tonk crowd",Honky Tonk Crowd,This One's Gonna Hurt You,1992,10,4:03,Track '10',Album,False
575,N/A,Chris LeDoux,"The Nashville friends they think I'm strange
To make my home out on the range
They think it's nothin' but a God forsaken land
Why don't you bring your guitar and family
Move on down to Tennessee
Well, I just smile 'cause they don't understand

But if they ever saw a sunrise on a mountain mornin'
And watched those cotton candy clouds go by
Then they'd know why I live beneath these western skies

I got peace of mind and elbow room
I love the smell of the sage in bloom
I catch a rainbow on my fishin' line
We got county fairs and rodeos
Ain't a better place for my kids to grow
Just turn 'em loose in the western summer time

And if you, ever held your woman on a summer's evening
While the prairie moon was blazin' in her eyes
Then you'd know why I live beneath these western skies

You ain't lived until you've watched those northern lights
Set around the campfire and hear the coyotes call at night
Makes you feel alright

So I guess I'll stay right where I'm at
Wear my boots and my cowboy hat
But I'll come and see you once in a while
I'll bring my guitar and sing my songs
Sorry if I don't stay too long
I love Tennessee, but you know it just ain't my style

I gotta be where I can see those rocky mountains
Ride my horse and watch an eagle fly
I gotta live my life and write my songs beneath these western skies
And when I die you can bury me beneath these western skies, yippee-aye",Western Skies,Whatcha Gonna Do With A Cowboy,1992,2,2:33,Track 'B',Single,False
