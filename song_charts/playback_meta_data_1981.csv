I hope that it's shining on you
The nights are getting cold in Cherokee County
There's a Blue Norther passing through

I remember green eyes and a ranchers daughter
But remember is all that I do
Losing you left a pretty good cowboy
With nothing to hold on to

And drank a drink or two

Sometimes when the wind blows you can see
The mountains and all the way to Malibu

Everyone's a star here in L.A. County
You ought to see the things that they do
All the cowboys down on the Sunset Strip
Wish that they could be like you

The Santa Monica Freeway
Sometimes makes a country girl blue
You're the reason God made Oklahoma

Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat

I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nightclubs
Lookin' for a place to play

Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man

Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck

I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started pickin' out some of them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar

I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
(We don't need a guitar man, son)

So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile, Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's

A little four-piece band was jammin'
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
(Show 'em, son)

If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill

Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin' the finest little five piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico

Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band

Scatter my clothes all over the floor
Wishing I could do the same thing in my head

With eyes like ace up dice
And Grey Beard's frown turned upside down
To a smile as cold as ice

From somewhere out of sight

Pick up my shove, l put my back to the grind
Got another job in Flagstaff and this one's paid

I work the freeway, the pays all right
But I can't get you off my mind
'Cause every stretch of highway ends the same

All roads lead to you
I thought I could forget but it's now use
Your memory is there wherever I go, whatever I do
All road lead to you

The boss said one more mile to go
The last one always goes so slow
If I could just turn off my mind I'd be all right

But I keep wondering what went wrong
Whose holding you now that I'm gone
There's not a minute that goes by you don't cross my mind

I think I see you in every car that passes by
No way around it I'll always love you

This morning is Monday where are you now
Teasin' my memory teaching me how
To lay low when I don't want to.

Well, love is elusive this I know now
It's making me crazy leaving me out
In the open when I don't want to.

The moments of pleasures never do last
Are gone like a suitcase full of your past
Long gone and in a hurry.

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more then I've already been
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby I should be ashes by now.

The second street beggars alone in their life
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night
Like I am They're just like I am.

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more then I've already been
Just like a wild fire you're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby I should be ashes by now.

490,N/A,Don McLean,"In the beginning there was nothingness and God but waved his hand
And from the endless void there sprang the beauty of the land
And high above the canyon walls the diamond stars were new
And breezes blew from nothingness and herbs and grasses grew
And silent creatures roamed the Earth and multiplied their kind
And man was but a molecule that God had left behind.

We have grown we have grown, we have captured the throne
Of the kingdom God made for our winning. 
We have grown we have grown, but our children alone
Have so little time left for beginning.

And mountains sprang and chaos rang the overture of life
And rivers coursed the twisted blade of natures sharpest knife
And cut beneath the rolling dales a gateway to the sea
While tidal waves and mighty gales were heard in symphony
And sunshine fell upon the waves and warmed the virgin land
And from the mud a drop of blood was left upon the sand.

We have grown we have grown, we have captured the throne
Of the kingdom God made for our winning. 
We have grown we have grown, but our children alone
Have so little time left for beginning.

And eagles flew from craggy peaks above the garden wall.
The drop of blood became a man, the tree of life grew tall.
And perfect in his loneliness, a rib pulled from his chest
Formed a sweet companion of pulchritude and breast.
And from the tree of knowledge God said they could not eat.
And perfect was their paradise unto the serpent at their feet.

We have grown we have grown, we have captured the throne
Of the kingdom God made for our winning. 
We have grown we have grown, but our children alone
Have so little time left for beginning.

Tree of knowledge, tree of death, upon the ground they trod.
The serpent said your eye's will see and ye will be a god.
Defy the word and eat the fruit and ye will never die
And you will chart your destiny and rule the Earth and sky.
And man was banished east of Eden. See what we have lost.
For though the father sets the price, the children pay the cost.

We have grown we have grown, we have captured the throne

To drink from the river till the river ran dry
He drank so long and he drank so hard
The river ran dry and it broke his heart

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Many are the times that he called his love
Called her to his side till he had enough
Then came a wind to blow her away
Never did he drink from the river that day

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Pricked by a thorn and heart will bleed
Red as a rose for the world to see
Chained by time to the river side
A fool will drink till the river runs dry

Drink from the river, fly like a dove

Come in hung over this morning
My woman met me at the door
Preaching me this warning
She said ""You're gonna have to change
Your sinful way of living""
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven

Well I promised to go to church with her
About a month of Sundays ago
And here it is, it's Sunday again
And I ain't been once in a row
And every time that old church bell rings
You can hear my rod and reel singing

She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven
'Cause there ain't no way
All my sins could be forgiven
There's only Ten Commandments
But I broke at least eleven
She's playing Hell
Trying to get me to Heaven

She went out and bought me
A Sunday go-meeting suit
And I must confess it looked pretty sharp
With my old hunting boots
But I wore holes in both the knees
Trying to roll them sevens
