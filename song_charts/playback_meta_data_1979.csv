0,1,Kenny Rogers,"Evryone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

""I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man""

Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you

Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you

I'll bring fire in the winters

Burning lines in the book of our lives

3,4,Kenny Rogers,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through,
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully

Or am I really lying here with you?

Just one touch and then it happens every time
There I go, I just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you

I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due

But I'll take your bet and you're gonna regret

'Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
Then he pulled the bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cries

Yippie-i-oh
Yippie-i-ay
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd
But he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire-as they ride on hear their cries

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
""If you wanna save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
Then, cowboy, change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies""

By nine o'clock it was hotter than the devil's torch
Momma said we need some fresh water
And she handed me the bucket down from the porch
She said why don't you let your little brother tag along with you
The spring was not more than fifty yards away

Little brother stopped when we got down to the orchard
I figured he was going to wait there in the shade
But then I seen him reach down in the tall grass
He was trying to pick up something laying in the sand
I yelled Lord, Lord brother look out!
There lay a cottonmouth
But that thing bit little brother on the back of the hand

I picked him up and ran back to the house then
I hollered hurry up momma and call Dr. Brown
She said I can't call nobody cause the phone's dead
Stormed last night and blown the lines all down
She said hurry up son and run on over to the Jackson's
And see if Mr. Jackson can haul you on into town
I started running off in that direction
While momma was trying to calm little brother down
Mr. Jackson hauled me into town to get the doctor
Doctor said I hope we ain't too late
When we drove up to the house I could see momma cryin'
And using her apron to wipe her tears away

That was one hot day down in Mississippi
Our RC Cola thermometer said 95
I watched the heat wave shimmering above the corn fields
While the doctor tried to keep little brother alive
The cows all bunched up down along the creek banks
And three old buzzards was wheeling in the hazy sky
And I was thumbing little rocks at some Dominicker chickens
Trying to look through my tear-filled eyes
Then I heard our old screen door a-slamming
And the doctor came out holding momma by the hand
He said I'm sorry but I can't do anymore for the boy
And a cottonmouth moccasin can kill a full grown man

Fourth day of August 1950
At eleven o'clock it was hot
And little brother was dead

He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

""I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek

You tear the soul from me

To turn and lock its door when you return

I know that you'll come back again

And I know what will happen then
One kiss and I'll give one to you

483,N/A,Eddie Rabbitt,"I'm glad we got it together
And got back together again
'Cause I was hurtin' for you
My nights, I thought they'd never end

And girl, I've paid in my mind, time after time
For the fool that I've been
I can't live without you

And I will never let you go again
I lost you once, my world came to an end
Time stood still, and I missed you, girl
And my heart just wouldn't mend
And I will never let you go again

I'm glad I woke up in time
Before I lost you all the way
I don't know what I'd have done
If you hadn't come back today

I don't know what made me think that I could go on
Without you by my side
It's no good without you
I just can't live without you

And I will never let you go again
I lost you once, my world came to an end
Well, the nights were long, and I missed you, girl
And my heart just wouldn't mend
And I will never let you go again
No, I will never let you go again
I lost you once, my world came to an end

Time stood still, and I missed you, girl
And my heart just wouldn't mend
And I will never let you go again",I Will Never Let You Go Again,Loveline,1979,10,,Track 'B2',LP,False
484,N/A,Eddie Rabbitt,"I knock on your door, it opens, and there you are
The light of my life shining like a star
You smile and tell me with your eyes
That I belong here

I leave all the pain of the world outside
Fall in your arms and it feels so fine
With you holding on to me
Well, girl, I'm strong here

And nothing feels like your amazing love
It always heals, your amazing love
I want you to know
That every night I thank all the stars above
My guiding light, your amazing love
Where would I be now if I hadn't found you?
Amazing love

I look in your eyes and I see a happy man
In love with a girl who understands
My heart you hold it in your hand
And girl, I need you

I wouldn't know what to do
I wouldn't know where to go without you

And nothing feels like your amazing love
It always heals, your amazing love

485,N/A,Eddie Rabbitt,"Heaven stirring in my bed
Raising up your pretty head
Like an angel in distress
And after all this time
Baby, you're still the best

And it's always like the first time
Every time we touch
You feel so new to me
And it's always like the first time
Every time we kiss
Baby, what you do to me?
Ooh

Sometimes when I look at you
I can't believe all we've come through
'Cause you're prettier today
And when you walk in the room
You still take my heart away

And it's always like the first time
Every time we touch
You feel so new to me
And it's always like the first time
Every time we kiss
Baby, what'd you do to me?

And it's always like the first time
Every time we touch
You feel so new to me, new to me
And it's always like the first time
Every time we kiss
Baby, what'd you do to me, do to me?

It's always like the first time
Every time we touch
You feel so new to me, new to me
