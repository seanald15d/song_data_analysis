I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' ""Sugar Pie"", ""Honey"", ""Darlin'"", and ""Dear""
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep

But it never sank in till that girl got a hold of me

I'm crossing my fingers, and counting every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

Pick her up to watch TV

She'll move a little closer

Got a little girl waitin' on me and I wanna treat her right""

My ol' heart was racing as she climbed inside
She slid over real close and drove down to the lake road
Watched the Sun fade in that big red sky

I reached under the front seat and said 
""Now here's something special
It's just been waiting for a night like tonight""

""There's someone you should meet.""
At a crowded restaurant way 'cross town

She walked in, their eyes met, and they both stared
And right there and then, everyone else disappeared

But one boy, one girl
Two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly, it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, and they knew right away
This was the day they'd waited for all their lives
And for a moment the whole world
Revolved around one boy and one girl

In no time at all they were standing there,
In the front of a little church
Among their friends and family, repeating those sacred words
The preacher said, ""Son kiss your bride"" and he raised her veil
Like the night they met, time just stood still

For one boy, one girl
Two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly, it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, they knew right away
That this was the day they'd waited for all their lives

Sayin' dad was gone
Could I come quick, he left a note for me.

But when she put her arms around me
And I held her I knew
It was just too soon to take another chance

Deep inside I knew that it was wrong
I could hold her in my arms for the rest of the night

And he rode for all his horse would ride, and I know he done his best
But he crossed over Jordan, ridin' Dunny to his death

On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good

There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes

And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""

And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down""

It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman,
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ears

She said, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your mama's gonna move you uptown

And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

And she painted my eyes and lips

That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good

There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

And the baby's gonna starve to death""

""To thine own self be true""

And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite

And an occasional aristocrat

And an elegant New York townhouse flat

Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ears

She said, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down

Cruised the strip on rock and roll
And drove around on ""Miles and Miles of Texas""

It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""
She said just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy
Don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now, don't let me down, now,

Well, that was the last time I saw my Mama
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
Wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do
And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

Don't let me down

Took me in off the streets

I charmed a king, a congressman,
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out

Stand down on Beale Street

And sing a Dixie Lullaby.

587,N/A,Tracy Byrd,"It's cold this time of year and the people
In this city make it colder
They've all forgotten what it means
To lend a hand or cry on a shoulder
In this land of opportunity
We fight like hell to make an extra dime
It would surely get the best of me 
Without the heaven in my woman's eyes

It's the heaven in my woman's eyes
That make life's hell a better place to be
It's the heaven in my woman's eyes
That gives the inspiration that I need
Sometimes it seems a man is born
To lose no matter how hard he tries
Life on earth would sure be hell
Without the heaven in my woman's eyes

Simplicity was once a way of life
Now it's buried with our past
A dollar used to go a long, long way
But now it just goes fast
Oh, how I wish that I could be
As free as our Union eagle flies
But the only time I'm free is when
I view the heaven in my woman's eyes

It's the heaven in my woman's eyes
That make life's hell a better place to be
It's the heaven in my woman's eyes
That gives the inspiration that I need
Sometimes it seems a man is born
To lose no matter how hard he tries
Life on earth would sure be hell
Without the heaven in my woman's eyes

588,N/A,Tracy Byrd,"I could tell she was a hot rod when she walked in all alone
Made a pit stop at the front bar, in a puff of smoke was gone
I followed her smell of perfume, 'cause she was too far out of sight
Tried to catch up but the girl was running one hell of a race tonight

She's a real low maintenance, country music beat driven, honky-tonk dancin' machine
All it takes to keep her tuned up is boots and Wrangler jeans
She scoots about fifty times around the floor on one shot of Jim Beam
She's a real low maintenance, country music beat driven, honky-tonk dancin' machine

There's a guy on every corner, watching her make the bend
Hoping he'll be the next one to take her for a spin

She's not the kind that can be hot wired with money or romance
Got a body for pleasure, but all she wants to do is dance

589,N/A,Tracy Byrd,"You looked at me as only you can look at me
You touched my cheek and told me not to cry
But you said you'd found somebody you loved more than me
And you told me I'd forget you by and by

But you lied to me, yes you lied to me
You said time would close the wound that bled inside of me
But every breath I take brings back your memory
You said I'd forget you, but you lied to me

Monday, I said Tuesday you'd be off my mind
Then I gave myself 'til Wednesday then on down the line
Funny how September turns to June so fast
And you told me this pain was not the kind to last

But you lied to me, yes you lied to me
You said time would close the wound that bled inside of me
But every breath I take brings back your memory
You said I'd forget you, but you lied to me

590,N/A,Tracy Byrd,"I can't say looking back right now 
Just where our love went wrong
But the hard cold fact is she's not here she's gone
Made me a promise she'd be true till the rivers all ran dry
The rivers still runnin' but she's long said goodbye

That's why I'm down on the bottom
Where the Moccasin's King and the big tall cypress grow
Seems the only place that a country boy 
Can find some peace of mind
And get back up, is on the bottom

Got friends in the world outside 
But none quite like ol' Cajun Joe
He lives down a slough where the river used to flow
Worked real hard most of his life 
Till the pushin' came to shove
Gave it all he had but he just couldn't rise above

That's why he's down at the bottom
Where the alligator swims and the old grey moss hangs low
Seems the only place that a country boy 
Can find some piece of mind
And get back up, is on the bottom

I can get back up, here on the bottom

You wouldn't listen you just had to go
And take her back again
Knowing you couldn't win
She's put you through all this before
And you don't need that heartache anymore

I feel the hurt that's inside of you
I've seen all the things she's put you through
Now you're alone and ache
She's finally made you break
Your troubles just walked out the door
You don't need that heartache anymore

Maybe in a while you'll feel better
Try real hard to forget her
She ain't worth your teardrops
Or walking the floor
It's gonna take time but I know you'll do it
Come on heart you can get through it
You don't need that heartache anymore

Maybe in a while you'll feel better

She ain't worth your teardrops

As she walked away
What a fine time to tell me 
To have a nice day
She's gone now but the words she said 
Still linger on and on
Have a good one, thought I had one, 
I guess I was wrong

She could have said I'm sorry

I've kept your heart in a state of doubt
