Oh, listen to the children while they play
Ain't it kind of funny what the children say?
Skip a rope

Daddy hates mommy, mommy hates dad
Last night you should have heard the fight they had
It gave little sister another bad dream
She woke us all up with a terrible scream

Skip a rope, skip a rope
Oh, listen to the children while they play
Ain't it kind of funny what the children say?

Skip a rope

Cheat on your taxes don't be a fool
What was that they said about the golden rule?
Never mind the rules, just play to win
And hate your neighbor for the shade of his skin

Skip a rope, skip a rope

Stab 'em in the back that's the name of the game

1,2,Jeannie C. Riley,"I want to tell you all the story bout the Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said, ""Mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A.""

Well, the note said, ""Mrs. Johnson, you're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' 'round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up your little girl this way""
And it was signed by the Secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A.

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't Widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled completely down?

Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother, I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites!""

No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.

2,3,Johnny Cash,"I hear the train a-comin', it's rollin' round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee snd smokin' big cigars
Well, I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line

Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde

The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game

The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
With the end growing closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught

They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dyin' they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde

Two years of runnin' was ended that day
For robbin' and killin' they both had to pay
But we'll always remember how they lived and died

And from the start he never had a chance
And though the doctors said he couldn't live his mama had some faith to give
And they brought him to her and his mama named him Vance
He was sick a long time then I used to sit by him
I'd rub his head he would squeeze my hand
But he never cried he'd grit his teeth and smile at me 'cause he couldn't speak
And that's when I began to respect the little man
And I think Vance was three right about then
He started school and one day he came home and at the doorway
I could tell the little man didn't want to come inside
He'd met a girl but her boyfriend Smitty
Had caught him walkin' home with her and nearly killed Vance
But then Vance never cried and the only thing that Smitty hurt was pride
And he said papa do you become a man when you're twenty one
And I said age doesn't make a man a man my son
He looked at me so puzzled with eyes so young and kind
And I think Vance was seven about that time

I guess they say that first love is the very best
At least it was with Vance 'cause he'd scratched Becky on his desk
But Becky went with Smitty and Vance was very small
And he used to dream what it'd be like to be tall
And then a few years later Vance came in one day
And told me and his mama that he had to go away

He came in and he hugged his mama

Callin' him soldier but Vance kept his cool
And he said papa that guy is Smitty and he's to be pitied now
Cause that's the same guy that used to bully me in school
Then Smitty said the wrong thing when he brought up Becky's name
And Vance finally stood and said boy what did you say
And it did my heart so much good when Vance hit ole Smitty
And it took two of Smitty's friends to carry him away

Down where the old Red River flows
I vowed my love to her forever 
She was my sweet, sweet Rosie Jones.

We walked alone down by the river 
Just as the sun was sinking low
And in her eyes I saw big trouble 
Like the muddy waters down below.

Her lips were soft and sweet as honey 
Her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses 
She was my sweet, sweet Rosie Jones.

And then one day a tall dark stranger 
With hair as black as winter coal
Rode into town as night was falling 
And there he met my Rosie Jones.

I woke next morning just after sunup 
To find a note from my Rosie's hand
And it read I'd rather die than ever hurt you 
But I'm in love with that tall dark man.

So now I walk alone down by the river 
Where my sweet Rosie used to stroll
And soon I'm gonna join those deep dark waters 
For I can't live without Rosie Jones.

I'll watch the same four men as they unload love again

And I knew our life was in the past.

How do you tell him his daddy's going away?
Do I tell him that I reached the autumn of my life
And that he'll understand some winter's day?

I'll lose my shape fast draggin' cotton sacks and eatin' butter beans ever day
Yeah, I'm a sweet young thing I just turned eighteen and I'm unhookin' the latch
'Cause I've got too much class for this cotton patch

I've been readin' magazines on a once-a-week trip to town on Saturday
And I've seen all pretty clothes and had some rich men and I know that's for me

Here comes a truck I'm in luck he's goin' straight through on a Dallas run
Yeah I am headin' for big D and I know that's place for me to really make a catch
Well, finally I'm a gettin' my class out of this cotton patch

I arrived in style aboard that big semi and I felt mighty high
Waltzin' into the best department store for employment to suit my style
And I was doin' pretty good till some wisecracker came on the scene
He called me a ripe tomato, but he said I sure look green

I tried every door to every store in town, but my luck had run down
It seemed nobody round Dallas could recognize the class I'd brought to town
And after all day of looking, would you believe the only job I could land
Was in a dog food factory stickin' labels on dog food cans

Dear mama how are you, pop and the kids? Hope you're doin' okay
Me, I never did find a better job, and all the rich men got away
Mama, I've been thinkin' pretty soon you know, I'll be nineteen
And I sure learned a lot about class fast, mama, know what I mean?
Mama, if you'd ask papa if he could spare a few dollars

Pity a man for he don't know
The trouble he'll pass going down life's road

When a man is one and twenty, he thinks he knows it all
He can't see down the road of life where he'll ever fall
But fall he will as he travels through life
With all its pitfalls troubles and strife

Now at fifty, he's going real strong
He has him a family and a nice little home
But old age is creeping up his spine
And the day is coming when the sun won't shine

Now at sixty, he won't have to guess
He's already missed the boat that leads to success
But he's done his best and he can't see why
The fame of life just passed him by

Now at seventy, he can see the light
And he knows he's never been very bright
But he's done his best as he's travelled by
And now all he can do is just sit and sigh

Now at eighty, he's ready for the wreath
He's wore out his hair and two sets of teeth
He has rheumatism in his hands and feet
And nothing seems good to eat

So you can pity him as he goes up the line
As he wobbles on the spindle and he's almost blind
And you can tell by the way that he travels alone
That it won't be long before he's going home

But if he's kept the commandments as he's travelled through life
He'll have a home in heaven where there'll be no strife
He's worked all his life to get things the way he wants them
He comes here against his will and he goes away disappointed",Fate Of Man,Wichita Lineman,1968,11,2:50,Track 'A6',Album,False

I was outside running barefoot in the rain

If she could come outside and play with me

Had a love without beginning or an end
And every day she lived with me
Was like a new day dawning once again

And I've loved her since
Every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips

And at night I heard her cry

I figured I'd be home in a week if my luck held this way

I was hungry and I was freezing done caught a chill

There was a bus full of kids a comin' from town
They were right in the middle when Joe tapped the hill

Gave his own life to save that bunch of kids

A sigh is just a sigh
