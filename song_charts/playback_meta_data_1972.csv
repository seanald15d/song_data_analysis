And you've heard almost ev'ry nursery rhyme
So, tonight before you go to sleep

Once upon a time there was a castle
And in this castle lived a King and Queen
And it came to pass, they were both were blessed
By one little blue-eyed princess
With the softest golden curls you've ever seen.

But then one day, he met this pretty lady
And she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your mommy sad

And she took his hand and led him far away

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes
Just another pretty bedtime story
So, please forgive mommy if she cries.

Then it came to pass, the King grew lonely
And the pretty lady wasn't all she seemed
He realized that he was wrong
And started his long journey home
For he misses little Princess and his Queen.

Then he was back and safe inside his castle
And tears of joy came pourin' down like rain
Then the castle rang with laughter
They lived happy ever after
Knowin' he would never leave again.

Still, it's just another bedtime story
But tellin' it brings teardrops to my eyes

30,31,Johnny Cash,"I dedicate this song to the workin' man
For ever' man that puts in 
Eight or ten hard hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody lookin' down his neck
Tryin' to get more out of 'im
Than he really ought to have to put in.

After twenty-nine long years of workin'
In this shop with Oney standin' over me ...
Today when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire ...

The superintendent just dropped by and said
They'd planned my little get together ...
Then he said I'd never a made it
If old Oney hadn't held me to the fire.

I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the mornin' feelin' tired ...
And old Oney don't remember, when I came here
How he tried to get me fired ...
With his folded hands behind him
Every mornin' Oney waited at the gate ...
Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
Clockin' in five minutes late.

But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen 'em do when any man retires
Then old Oney's gonna tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I desire ...

He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man at times like this ...
But there's one thing he's not countin' on
Today's the day I give old Oney his.

I've been workin', buildin' muscles
Oney's just been standin' 'round a gettin' soft
And today about four-thirty
I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost ...
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the workin' man who put his point across
With a right hand full of knuckles
Cause today I show old Oney who's the boss.

Hmmmm! What time is it? Four thirty!

That I wrote especially for my friends with drinkin' problems
Or maybe I should say my friends with problems enough to drink
Anyway it's just an old theme of a man sittin' in a barroom tryin' to drown his past
It's called ""I'm Turnin' Off A Memory""

You can find me in a dim-lighted barroom
If your coldness should ever turn warm
But the chances of you ever changing
Are as slim as your two loving arms

So I'm turning off a memory
As quickly as time will allow
Yes, I'm turning off a memory
And the wine seems to help me somehow

If I'm lucky I'll someday forget her
When the wine finally takes full control
But that's not much of a future to look to
But I can't stand this pain in his soul

How telling 'em how he missed a gear and that Volkswagen full of hippies
Passed us like I was sitting up on jacks or how we took that curve over on 66
Han't-a been for me hanging on the shoulder we'd both wound up in the ditch
If we're on time he takes the credit if we're late I get the blame
Up those hills with shutters open my stacks are running flame
My stack a running red light sucking diesel from the tanks
I take him south and bring him back without a word of thanks
So now you've heard my story and I guess it's my tough luck
There'd be no truck drivers if it wadn't for us trucks
There'd be no truck drivers...

Look at him sipping coffee and flirtin' with that waitress
And where do you think he left me that's right next to cattle truck (mooo)
Why couldn't we have put me next to that little pink mack sittin' over there
Gosh she's got pretty mud flaps and talk about stracked they're both chromed
Well he'll be coming out in a minute and he'll get that bar
And he'll go around and beat on my tires
You know for two pints of diesel I'd have a flat on the inside dual
Ha that fixed him I never did like the way he drives anyhow
Thainks he's God's gift to waitresses he never gives 'em a tip

When you got no man to give it his last name
And her folks back in Manhattan didn't want her or her bundle
So she took her child and caught an evenin' train

She found a job in Denver washing dishes in a diner
At least it buys her baby milk to drink
He once told her she was pretty but the only ring it got her
Was the ring of grease that runs around the sink

Yes she lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told her that he loved her
And he made her dance before the music played
But at least she didn't beg him
She'd rather wash her dishes
It makes her feel as if her hands are clean

At night she stands there thinkin'
'Bout the man back home in Kansas
And how her folks just turned away the shame
She stares down through the soap suds
Reaches down and pulls the drain plug
And watches as Manhattan drains away

Yes she lay beside him gentle
'Cause he told her that he loved her
And he made her dance before the music played

I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use

There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of

As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

And, oh, I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be

His face was round and reddish and his hair was slightly curled
He didn't look too different from the others I had seen
Who'd-a-thought he was the answer to the nation's dream?

At first he didn't seem to be intelligent at all
Each time he'd start to walk about he'd stumble and he'd fall
My first impression was to be a most mistaken thought
Lord a'mighty, what's this little hairy monkey wrought?

Because I witnessed his departure from his mother's womb
I felt inclined to check his progress every afternoon
One day the keeper of the zoo called in the live TV
""Frankly said, I think you'll be amazed at what you see"".

The monkey walked and talked and waved his arms about his head
In the corner was the stack of books that he had read
""An educated monkey!"" said the papers 'cross the land
It was more than weary sociologists could stand


Oh, his fame was universal, he was on the carson how
People talked about him kindly everywhere he'd go
His insight was amazing, his philosophy was fair
He became a politician welcome everywhere

His wit was not to be compared with any mind intact
He'd lace a phrase with irony and blend it all with fact
Conservatives applauded and the liberals were entranced
The bigots and the integrationists were in his camp

Nobody dared to meet him in an open press debate
He was nominated by the folks from every state
Yes, a monkey was the president, though maybe not the first
And there was peace and harmony throughout the universe

To make growing up a little easier to do
'Cause when you have to live with yourself takes a lifetime
So here goes a little something to hang on to.

Get to know who you are and what you're doing here
Find out exactly where you're going and where you've been
And change the things you can and accept the things you can't
And don't you ever forget you, your best friend

And you gotta do more than put a little love in your heart
You gotta let loose and give it all away
And no matter who you are you need to exercise your soul
And take a little walk with Jesus everyday.

And say thank you for the life you've been given
And don't you ever forget that golden rule
'Cause the least you can do for your conscience
Is give it a little something to hang on to

And when you're down you can't give up if you're losin'
'Cause you may need to get lost to be found
And when you get starting up, well you'll always see the stars
So don't live it up if you can't live it down
And you're gonna get back from life what you've given
So give it all you got and before you know

It'll get easier and easier to live with yourself

Of what words would deny
When we analyzed the meaning
Of I love you and good-bye

Was the birth of a woman and a man

Once upon a time there was a castle and in this castle lived a king and queen
And it came to pass they both were blessed by one little blue eyed princess
With the softest golden curles you've ever seen
And then one day he met this pretty lady and she had lots of pretty words to say
And this part makes your mommy sad cause oh what big eyes she had
And she took his hand and led him far away

Just another pretty bedtime story so please forgive mommy if she cries

Then he was back and safe inside his castle

With the softest golden curls you've ever seen.

And she took his hand and led him far away

And started his long journey home

When you're gone
Kiss an angel good morning
And love her like the devil 
When you get back home.

The secret of happiness
But some of them never learn 
That it's a simple thing.

The secret I'm a-speaking of
Is a woman and a man in love
The answer is in this song 
That I always sing.

Well she said my name is Jannie and asked me what was mine
I answered Hank as I walked to the jukebox droppin' a dime
Checked out her short dress low neck line
Well we danced for five or ten minutes and I held her close to me
Kissed her lips and squeezed her hips and judged about twenty three
Whispered in my ears I said yes siree
Now the scene is a little motel out on the state highway
There in room 12 little love is about to take place
And a state trooper breaks down the door shines a flash light in my face
I said what the hell is this and another man and woman come in
And the girl I'm with starts cryin' and screamin' and she runs over to them
Said thank God you're here he tried to hurt me mama
I said now you don't mean the cop says son the girl is seventeen
So that's why I'm in Knoxville courthouse and the judge passed sentence on me
And it's ten long years for statutory rape in the state penitentiary
Lord I can't believe this is happened to me
So when next time you give a girl the eye she gives you that certain smile
Just remember under that woman's breast may beat the heart of a child
Don't you let yourself be the one to help a mixed up kids go wild

Down on Music City Row
I was lookin' for a place to get
Myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feelin'
That was eatin' at my soul
And keep the chilly winds off my guitar.

My thirsty wanted whiskey
And my hunger needed beans
But I guess it'd been a month of payday
Since I heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty
And a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually I guess you'd call it a tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling
Sawdust on the floor friendly shadows.

I saw that there was just
An old man sittin' at the bar
In the mirror I could see him
Checkin' me and my guitar
He said come up here boy
Show us what you are
I said I'm dry, he bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar.

Said it's a tough life ain't it
I just looked at him
And he said you ain't
Makin' any money are you
I said you been readin' my mail
He just smiled and said let me see that guitar
I got somethin' you oughta hear
Then he laid it on me.

If you waste your time a talkin'
To the people who don't listen
To the things that you are sayin'
Who do you thinks gonna hear
And if you should die explainin'
How the thing they complain about
Or the things they could be changing
Who do you thinks gonna care.

There were lots of other singers
In the world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
Now their voices have been scattered
By the swirling winds of time
And the truth remains that no one wants to know.

Well, the old man was a stranger
But I'd've heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out
On the wrong side of the door
No one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind

You see the devil haunts a hungry man
And if you don't wanna join him
Well, he's gotta figure out someway to beat him
And I ain't sayin' I beat the devil
But I drink his beer for nothin'
And then I stole his song

You can still hear me singin'
To the people who don't listen
To the things that I am sayin'
Prayin' someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining
How the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin'
Hopin' someone's gonna care.

Haulin' 36 ton on a run called the Nitro Express.
There was nothin' but curves a runnin' from the top on down,
And at the bottom of the grade sat a quiet little country town.

Well, I was drivin' off the top when she jarred and the driveshaft broke,
Started pumpin' up the brakes, saw 'em going in a big cloud of smoke.
To keep 'er upright ...I knew I had to do my best,
Against a runaway bomb they call the Nitro Express.

There was 36 ton of a detonated steel,
Over 18 tires that smoked and squealed.
I had to ride her down and I couldn't jump free,
Or there'd be a big hole where that little town used to be.

Well that old trailer leaned each time that I took another curve,
My hands started sweatin' and I knew I was losin' my nerve.
And I was cussin' each rock and every inch of the Devil's Crest,
A fightin' with the wheel of a rig called the Nitro Express.

I side-swipped a mountain so I'd slow her down by rubbin' her side,
And when the sparks started flyin' man it looked like the 4th of July.
I finally got her stopped ... but mister I'm a gonna confess,

That you yourself lived in that other time.

You bring sorrow and grief.
You made me ashamed to face Mary.
Barely had the strength to tell.

Runnin' as fast as I can.

Glad I'm comin' home again.
Never again will I ever
Cause another tear to fall.
Down the beach I see
What belongs to me,
The one I want most of all.

He looked like a man had lived a hard life and the hurt of it showed on his face
Hunger for food showed through his loose clothes
That you could tell were once tailored to fit
And a distant look was in his eyes as though he'd just seen hell's fiery pits
When I first spoke to him it seemed like he didn't hear a sound
And I stood there for a minute and thought he might be deaf
But then he turned around
And acted like he wanted to say something but couldn't speak
So I took him by the arm and said would you like to talk to me
In his humble voice so shaky soft and low
Said you look like an old friend of mine someone from long long ago
Then he said I've been thinkin' a lot about a little place not too far away from here
Where they sing and pray and they say God will answer prayers
But I can't seem to find it by myself would you walk with me over there
Then I choked the tears back before I could say a word
Then the church bells started ringin' the prettiest I ever heard
And as we walked toward the church house we'd stop along the way
And just listen to the church bells ring out God's holy day
And as we walked into that sacred place
I felt I was all alone with God but my friend had gone away
And then as I knelt down to pray it was all so plain to see
That the friend that I'd been talkin' to was my own soul inside of me
And for the first time I found myself inside myself with God's helping hand

Boy I'm placing you under arrest.

Or you can get out of town before sundown 
And don't you never come back
Take your tambourine and your guitar string 
And move on down the track.

Don't like the way that you comb your hair 
The way you drawl you all
And if you're not out of town before sundown 
You won't get out of town at all.

Well, I hitchhiked down to Phoenix I was following the sun
Prettiest place I think I've ever seen
I met a sweet young lady, but how was I to know
That pretty thing was only seventeen.

Then I saw the red lights gleamin' 
And I heard the sirenes screamin'
A sound that fills the bravest hearts with fear
And that old sheriff didn't stutter 
When to me those words he uttered
Boy don't let the sun set on you here.

Well, I'm so sick and tired of gettin' up
So sick and tired
Sick old dirty clothes and dirty dishes
I'm tired of all these sleepless nights
That drive me up to walls
Tired of having arms full of empty

Done me wrong and that ain't funny

I promise you that I won't be mad
For I never was one to burn bridges
I ain't had no tender loving care

She'll soon be back within my arms

And the sun shines through the silver in your hair
I'll think of all the years we've spent together
And of all the good and bad times we've shared

We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And felt sadness like the flaming pits of hell
But each things we share just makes our love grow stronger
And I love you more than words could ever tell

When the golden years have slowly come upon us
And our children have all married off and gone
You know, sweetheart each day our love grows more exciting
And I love you more as each day passes on

We've seen happiness that could match heaven's beauty
And felt sadness like the flaming pits of hell
And each day as we grow closer to God's calling
I pray He'll call us at the same time

But she didn't dig my runnin' around all night
Well I warned you a couple of times about leavin'
Oh but you just laughed and took it kinda light
Well I should've paid attention to her warnin'
When she told me she'd leave if I didn't change
'Cause when I come home about sunup this mornin'
Well I detected somethin' mighty strange
Her and the car and the mobile home are gone boys
I was takin' off while you was a carryin' on
Now things are really shot I came home to an empty lot
Yeah me and the car and the mobile home was gone
Yeas her and the car and the mobile home was gone

Well the neighbors all around me were a laughin'
And it made me feel about ten inches tall
Ha I knew you didn't think that I'd really leave you
Ah not to mention takin' home and all
Well talk about somebody be-wildered
I bet you didn't know what to do nor where to go
I found a little consolation in my wardrobe that you left scattered on the patio
Her and the car and the mobile home...
(Yeah they was gone with everything else
Except a few old western suits she'd left scattered there on the patio
And they had mud on 'em where she'd stomped around on 'em
Stepped on them Wagon wheels busted the spokes out
You know that real nice lavander suit one that she said I looked good in
Said I looked like Tom Jones that's it hangin' over in that tree

As we walked the road of love we lost our way

Our careless steps have led us to the end
Oh and all we can do now is just feel sorry for each other
Cause once love has died it won't ever live again
