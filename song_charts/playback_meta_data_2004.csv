0,1,Tim McGraw,"He said, ""I was in my early 40s
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days
Looking at the X-rays
And talking 'bout the options, and talking 'bout
Sweet time
I asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya when you get that kind of news
Man, what'd ya do""
And he said

""I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying""
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

He said, ""I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden goin' fishin'
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well, I, I finally read the Good Book
And I took a good long hard look
At what I'd do if I could do it all again
And then

I went skydiving
I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named
Fumanchu,
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying""
And he said, ""Someday, I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'""

Like, tomorrow was a gift
And you got eternity to think about what'd you do
With it
What did you do with it?
What did I do with it?
What would I do with it?

I went Rocky Mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named

No, I can't swig that sweet champagne, I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern, or in a honky tonk, or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid, and Strait
Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip

Victoria's Secret, well their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price
And still look sexy, just as sexy as those models on TV

Well, you might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door

Hey I'm true down to the core

And I will always do my duty

4,5,Keith Urban,"I woke up early this morning around 4a.m.
With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's okay, there's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.

I went out driving, trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been.
So

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me.

Someday I'm gonna run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life.

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
And take your cat and leave my sweater
'Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me.

Take your records, take you freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me

5,6,Alan Jackson,"Remember when I was young and so were you
And time stood still, and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried, remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt, remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each others hearts, remember when

Remember when, the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up, remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now, lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again, remember when

Remember when we said, when we turn gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had 
And we'll remember when

6,7,Rascal Flatts,"I set out on a narrow way
Many years ago
Hoping I would find true love 
Along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign
Pointed straight to you

That every long-lost dream 
Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way
Into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
Yes, He did

I think about the years I spent
Just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost
And give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan
That is coming true

Led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart
They were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way

That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

I've been barefooting all day with my baby
Brown leaves have started falling
Leading the way

I like it best just like this
Doing nothing all the way
So let's lay down in the tall grass

And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by

Girl, you know you told me not so long ago
To let it come, then let it pass
And all your troubles and your sorrows
They won't last

So let me kiss you now, little darling

Cold winds, another season
Will be here soon

9,10,Blake Shelton,"Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign-car-driving dude
With a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone

He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and warm breeze is blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

I circled the parking lot
Trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar
Was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up

But from out of nowhere a Mercedez Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

Some beach, somewhere 
There's nowhere to go when you've got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot senoritas
Smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

Well, I sat in that waiting room
Seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said Doc's ready for you
Your not gonna feel a thing
We'll give you some novacaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two

But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

Some beach, somewhere
There a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air

In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night

We might stay like this all day

But on second thought, tonight I think I hate everything. 

Then he opened up his billfold and threw a 20 down 
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground 
And I picked it up he said Thank ya bud. 
I put it in his hand, He said I probably oughta throw

But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.

Son, You make me proud

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs 'cause ain't nothin'
Funny when a soldier cries, and I just wipe my eyes
I fold it up and put in my shirt get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on,

19,20,Kenny Chesney,"'Jack and Diane' painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-ton short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

Well, I used to rock all night long
To 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back)

Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back

And we can try out the four-wheel drive

I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wonderin' what I did
I said, Lord, please forgive me for my sins

My wife wanted to kill me, but she tried to save me first
""You're goin' if I have to drag your butt to church""

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beer, watched a game and cooked some steaks

My little brother had a big fight with his wife
And my poor mother sat between 'em both all night

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

Come on

We said a prayer for cousin Michael in Iraq
We're all aware that he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he loved to be a soldier more than most

I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life is like a roller coaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight

You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or I might live on for years

When she brings his eggs and fills his coffee cup,
He jokes about his love life, 
And tells her he's about ready to give up,
That's when she says ""I've been there before,
But keep on looking cause maybe who you're looking for is""

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Across town in a crowded elevator
He can't forget the things that waitress said
He usually reads the paper
But today he reads a strangers face instead
It's that blue eyed girl from two floors up
Maybe she's the one,
Maybe he could fall in love with

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everyday
Somebody that you look at but never really see
Somewhere out there is somebody

Now they laugh about the moment that it happened
The moment they'd both missed until that day
When he saw his future in her eyes 
Instead of just another friendly face
And he wonders why he searched so long
When she was always there at that diner waiting on

Somebody in the next car
Somebody on the morning train
Somebody in the coffee shop that you walk right by everyday

Around my finger
Oh it puts a smile in my heart

I realize what life is all about

It's hangin' on when your heart
Has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up

A reflection of who I am and what will be

Wasting my time just to get where I don't even wanna go

Start a tradition, lay down the law

I want to drink tequila down in Tijuana

She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart; he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night

Both:
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said 'I'll love her 'til I die'
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Alison Krauss:
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind

Both:
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger

And more for the two of us
Kisses each morning, I love you's at night

And said ""you know this isn't easy for me""

And wondered what that bottom line would be
And a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find

But that didn't stop him
From wishing that he did
Didn't keep him from wanting
Or worshipping him

Guesses he saw him
About once a year
He could still feel the way he felt
Standing in tears
Stretching his arms out
As far as they'd go
And whispering, ""Daddy
I want you to know""

I love you this much
And I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind
Do you love me too?
How ever long it takes
I'm never giving up
No matter what
I love you this much

He grew to hate him for what he had done
'Cause what kind of father
Could do that to his son?
He said, ""Damn you, daddy""
The day that he died
The man didn't blink
But the little boy cried

I love you this much
And I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind
Do you love me too?
How ever long it takes
I'm never giving up
No matter what
I love you this much

Half way through the service
While the choir sang a hymn
He looked up above the preacher
And he sat and stared at him
He said
""Forgive me, Father""
When he realized
That he hadn't been unloved
Or alone all his life
His arms were stretched out
As far as they go
Nailed to the cross
For the whole world to know

I love you this much
And I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind
Do you love me too?
How ever long it takes
I'm never giving up
No matter what
I love you this much",I Love You This Much,Jimmy Wayne,2003,12,,Track '10',Album,True

Had me begging for salvation

Introduced her to my old bird dog

Everything I own's in the back in a Hefty bag
I'm outta cigarettes and I'm down to my last drag

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rear view mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

Under fifty thousand miles ago
Before the bad blood and busted radio
You said I was all you'd ever need
But love is blind and little did I know
You were just another dead-end road
Paved with pretty lies and broken dreams
Baby leaving you is easier than being gone
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rear view mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now

Without a bunch of decorations
And a paper angel tree.

On artificial tree limbs
Saying what she'd love to have
And what to buy for him.

Well, I hope Maggie likes her new winter clothes
And her buggy with a baby doll
And maybe Tom'll smile in his new Nike shoes
When he shoots that basketball.

I can't help but wishing
That I could do more
But not just while I'm shopping
In the department store.

No matter where you are right now
Remember God's right there

Of his paper angels everywhere

I see a Mom and Dad's worst dream
There on the back of a money-saving ad
To get my carpet cleaned.

Height, weight, hair, eyes,
Date missing, and D.O.B.
A child's name, a picture
And the words 'Have you seen me?'

No matter where you are right now
Remember God's right there

Of his paper angels everywhere.

Fill a folder in a file

Drawn without a smile.

With this kind of debris
We've got to stop this madness

The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back

I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left

Grew up two little houses
Down from me.

On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.

Want playboys of the southwestern world.

We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town

Putting food there on the table,

I sold my acts and I quit them bars
Got a real job fixing trucks and cars
Had a couple new mouths to feed

And the finer points of the suburban age
All became bars on a cage

I started cussin' and getting mad at nothin'
And blaming her for ruining my life
Started sinking, cheating, and a-drinking

Right there by my side
With tears in her eyes

I got off on some wine with a waitress
Sonny had a girlfriend that just couldn't wait
JB hooked up around midnight
With an ugly girl from up in the city
He downed every can of beer in the cooler
Just tryin' to drink that poor thing pretty.

Never did get a degree

Sonny's got a good life, a baby and a good wife
And everyday he carries the mail
JB is a cross-country trucker
And he called last night from South Carolina
He said I fallen in love with a waitress
That I met at a Waffle House diner.

He said the years seem to roll on faster
Than they did back when we were kids
Then we need us a break from the grindstone
That's exactly what we did.

We put in a phone call to Sonny

She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart; he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night

Both:
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said 'I'll love her 'til I die'
And when we buried him beneath the willow

Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song

I go back to a two-ton short bed Chevy
Drivin' my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

Well, I used to rock all night long
To 'keep on rock'n me, baby'
At frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time

So, I go back to the pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, 'Only The Good Die Young' stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back
(I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back

Bad boy to the bone

On the road to nowhere fast
Till the grace of God got in the way.

Cried and said a prayer

You know just what works
Women rule the world

The way they talk, the way they giggle
The way they walk, the way they jiggle
Makes men buy 'em diamonds and pearls
That look when they're up to something
Soft touch, oh that lovin'
They're sexy when they're mamas
Cute when they're girls
Women rule the world

In all shapes and sizes
They make my temperature rise

From the days of my misspent youth.
I believe that down on the beach
Where the sea gulls preach
Is where the Chinese buried the truth.

So I dig in the sand
With my misguided hands
And if I dig deep enough
Hell I just might dig it up.
Talking about treasure
Talking about pleasure
Talking about love

Now I'm a reader of the night sky
And a singer of inordinate tunes.

Living way past my prime
Like a long lost baby's balloon.

Work that whole gravity thing
But when my space ship goes pop
Back to the earth I will drop
Into the sea
Or the limbs of a tree
Or the wings of my love

Maybe invent me a story or two

How 'bout you
How 'bout you

And stories are the key to the past
But now I'm stuck in between
Here at my typing machine
Trying to come up with some words that will last.

And if I just find the beat
I know I land on my feet

I've got scars, I've got lines
I'm not hard to define
Just an altar boy coverin' his ass.

It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""

Wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about

And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday

But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life

A year ago today
The rooster started crowing
When they carried dad away.

There beside my mother
In the livingroom, I stood
With my brother and my sister
Knowin' dad was gone for good.

Then I, I hung around
Just long enough to lay him in the ground
Then I caught a plane to do a show
Up north in Detroit town.

Because I'm older now and I ain't got not time to cry
I got no time to look back, I got no time to see
The pieces of my heart
That have been ripped away from me.

And if the feelings start to come in
I've learned to stop them fast
'Cause I don't know if I let 'em go
They might not wanna pass.

And there's just so many people
Tryin' to get me on the phone
And there's bills to pay and songs to play
And a house to make a home.

I guess I'm older now and I ain't got not time to cry
I can still remember before I heard of Merle
So many things have changed
So much here in my world.

I remember sitting on the front porch
When an ambulance drove by
Just listening to those sirens
I would break down and cry.

Now, I'm walkin' and I'm talkin'
Doin' just what I'm supposed to do
Working overtime to make sure
I don't come unglued.

Because I'm older now and I ain't got not time to cry
I sit down on the sofa and I watch the evening news
There's a half-a-dozen tragedies
From which to pick and choose.

The baby that was missing
Was found in a ditch today
And there's bombs flying
And people dying not so far away.

I'll take a beer from the fridgerator
And sit in the yard
With a cold one in my hand
I'm gonna bite down and swallow hard.

Because I'm older now
And I ain't got not time to cry.

When a third-grade education,
Was all the school you needed,
To work the family farm.
He'd take time off on Sunday,
Him and all his family,
Warm a pew,
And give thanks to the Lord.

There was no gray, only black and white.
Didn't need no one to tell him,
What was wrong or right.
'Cause he had God, Family, and Country.

He set aside his plow,
In early 1940,
Said goodbye to his small town,
And put on the Army green.
Hard Times on the front lines,
Writin' letters on wet paper,
Not one word about the awful things he'd seen.

His was a generation,
That answered without question.
They knew they had to win,
'Cause they were fightin' for...
God, Family, and Country.

On the coffee table,
Sits the family Bible,
Where just last year he added,
A little boy to the family tree.

There's the folded flag they gave us,
On the day he left us.
But the thing that I remember most,
Is the way that he...

Believed...

In God, Family, and Country...

But, girl, I think that I'm in love with you! 

Give me your love 
Give me your love 
That's what I need 
That's what I need 
How can I make you understand? 
Give me you love 
Give me your love 
That's what I'm needin' 
That's what I'm needin' 
Oh, girl, don't make me beg 
Please, please, please, please, please 
Don't make me beg! 

Oh, Honey, please, please, please, please, please 
Don't make me beg! 
Oh, Honey, please, please, please, please, please

I can look but I can't touch
I'm going crazy
'Cause I used to have your love
Now he has you, and it kills me
I'm still needin' you so much

I won't give up on you
Though I hurt like I do
My heart's broke
But don't be mistaken
I'm not breakin'
I'm not breakin'

I'll keep on waitin'
Just in case you change your mind
A chance worth takin'
Just to hold you one more night
My weakness, I'm your fool
I'd take you back a hundred times

I won't give up on you
Though I hurt like I do
My heart's broke
But don't be mistaken
I'm not breakin'
I'm not breakin'
