0,1,Willie Nelson,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied

You don't know what he wants
You don't know if he cries at night
You don't know if he don't

When nothin' comes easy
Old nightmares are real
Until you've been beside a man
You don't know how he feels

Where angels fear to tread

Some men go slow
Some men go just where they want
Some men never go

Ooh, shame on the moon

Comfort in a crowd
Strangers faces all around

You don't know who he knows

I seem to recall that certain look in your eye
I said who's that you said with a smile
Oh it's nobody, aww nobody
Maybe that explains the last two weeks
You call me up dead on your feet
Working late again I ask who with
You said nobody, aww nobody

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever (clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

Late last night we went for a drive
You were miles away
I ask who's on your mind
You said nobody (nobody) why do you ask
Oh her again, I couldve told you that
We came back home got ready for bed

I remember all the laughter and the tears we shared last night.
And as we lie here, just two shadows in the light before the dawn,
The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you.

And I have never been afraid of losing now.
And I have never wanted love to be a chain.
I only know that when I'm with you, you're my sunshine, you're my rain.
The sweetest thing I've ever known is loving you.

When eatin' my cookin' got the better of me,
So I asked this little girl I was goin' with to be my wife.
Well, she said she would, so I said, 'I do'.
But I'da said, 'I wouldn't' if I'da just knew how sayin' 'I do'
Was gonna screw up all o' my life.

Well, the first few years weren't all that bad.
I'll never forget the good times we had,
'Cause I'm reminded every month when I send her the child support.
Well, it wasn't too long till the lust all died.
And I'll admit I wasn't too surprised,
The day I came home and found my suitcase sittin' out on the porch.
Well, I tried to get in, she changed the lock.
Then I found this note taped on the mailbox that said,
""Goodbye, turkey. My attorney will be in touch.""
So I decided right then and there I was gonna do what's right
Give 'er her fair share but, brother,
I didn't know her share was gonna be that much.

She got the goldmine, (She got the goldmine,)
I got the shaft. (I got the shaft.)
They split it right down the middle,
And then they give her the better half.
Well, it all sounds sorta funny,
But it hurts too much to laugh.
She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.

Now listen up. You ain't heard nothin' yet.
Why, they give 'er the color televison set.
Then they give 'er the house, the kids and both of the cars.
See.
Well, then they started talkin' about child support, alimony,
And the costs to the court.
Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was.
I'm tellin' ya, they have made a mistake.
'Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes.
Besides, everythin' I ever had worth takin' they've already took.
While she's livin' like a queen on alimony.
I'm workin' two shifts, eatin' baloney.
Askin' myself, ""Why didn't you just learn how to cook?""

They give her the goldmine, (She got the goldmine,)
They give me the shaft. (I got the shaft.)
They said they're splittin' it all down the middle,
But she got the better half.

Standing out in front of Wilson's five and dime
Staring through the window at the jewelry
Hungry for the things you couldn't buy
Just like a fool I thought that I could please you
I saw you had an eye for things that shine
I paid seven sawmill dollars for a bracelet
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

Layin' by these railroad tracks in Denver
With a hurtin' head and a half a pint of wine
Everything except my soul has been surrendered
Just to satisfy your fourteen carat mind.

Was not enough to keep you satisfied

Can't afford to feed a rich girl's appetite

Sometimes I wonder if he's still alive
Ol' Willie he gave up his wife and children

Tryin' their best to survive

All the men were off to war and the women had nothing to do
I was sixteen and hungry for my first taste of love
When I brought the groceries to her door I didn't know how close I was

Her long blond hair was flowing and she smelled like sweet perfume
When I laid the groceries down she said you don't have to leave so soon
A woman sure gets lonely when her man's gone off to fight
She reached out for my trembling hand as teardrops filled her eyes then she said

War is hell on the homefront God only knows what a woman goes through
She still needs what a man that's gone can't do
I can't fight this fire alone stay with me until it's gone
Oh war is hell on the homefront too

It was July hot inside me as she lead me to her bedroom door
The satin sheets and pleasures I never knew I could feel before
My first taste of loving was everything that it should have been
When a woman's fighting loneliness it's a battle she can't win

I'll always remember what she did and what she said
But the one thing that I'll remember most
Is the way she turned his picture over
Face down on the table by her bed then she said

War is hell on the homefront too God only knows what a woman goes through

I was at this bar on the interstate
When this guy with this bird on his shoulder walked through the door
He proceeded to tell me the wildest thing
Sir this bird of mine can sing
Like no other bird you ever heard before
Well I kinda looked at the guy and said oh really
He turned to the bird and said do ole Willie

Whisky River take my mind
Don't let her memory torture to me
Whisky River don't run dry
You're all I've got take care of me

Well if that ain't the durndest thing
I thought son what a heck of a thing
A man could get rich making that bird sing
And I could feel this wild idea coming on strong
And besides I'm sitting here with two weeks pay
And I'd probably blow it on beer anyway
Hey wait 'til you hear him sing like George Jones

He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
Soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

I said well that does it sir
Yep I'd like to buy that bird
Five hundred dollars to take him off your hands
Well he thought for a while and he said alright
And he handed me the bird and he said good night
He counted my money and out the door he ran

Well I was thinking I'd found the rainbow's end
That the money would soon be pouring in
When suddenly the bird flew out the door and was gone
Well then it hit me and I got boiling made
'Cause I knew right then I'd been had
And as he flew off into the night he was singing this song

On the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
Somebody stop that bird
Well love is making money with my friends

You've always met me more than half the way,

And you could have packed your things and gone,

Did not understand the moods,

Gave me love everyday

This old place ain't home, it's just a stop in the road

Don't worry where we're goin', just drive till you feel right
We don't need a roadmap to get us out of sight
We'll start lookin' for a place where we can settle down
But right now, do us a favor, get us out of town

Drive this old machine like it's been entered in a race
Don't slow it down until you see a smile across my face
I could tell we didn't belong here without havin' to be told
This old place ain't home, it's just a stop in the road

Just a stop in the road, not where you're gonna say is born and raised
Just a stop in the road, too soon you get to feelin' out of place
You never see it but you feel it smirkin' every grin
Too soon you get the feelin' you're on the outside lookin' in
I wouldn't want to be caught here and find I'm gettin' old
This old place ain't home, it's just a stop in the road",Stop In The Road,I Just Came Home To Count The Memories,1981,10,,Track 'B1',Album,False
499,N/A,John Anderson,"I was down from a love that was falling
I went drinkin' in old San Antone
She walked in the bar and I watched her
I saw that she was alone

I sent her a drink and I waited
I felt hypnotized till she spoke
She asked me my name and I answered
She told me her name was Rose

And her dress was cut close but tastefully so
When she danced she was light on her toes
And I'll never forget the night when I met
And danced with the San Antone Rose

We spent almost all night together
I talked and she held me close
The pain I'd been feeling all ended
That night with the San Antone Rose

And her dress was cut close but tastefully so
When she danced she was light on her toes
And I'll never forget the night when I met
And danced with the San Antone Rose
No, I'll never forget the night when I met
And danced with the San Antone Rose",I Danced With The San Antone Rose,I Just Came Home To Count The Memories,1981,10,,Track 'B2',Album,False

501,N/A,John Anderson,"In a two room trailer down by the tracks on the edge of a Tennessee town
Jesse Clay lived with his lady and a one eyed Redbone hound
And every night at 12:05 he'd hear that whistle whine
And Jesse knew the train from Chattanooga was comin' by on time

And we all knew old Jesse Clay got mean when he drank too much
And Jesse's lady wore the scars of his not too gentle touch
And Jesse knocked her down one night just for bustin' a bottle of gin
She hit her head when she hit the floor and she never got up again

Now Jesse Clay was crazy scared when he saw her lyin' still
He took his lady in his arms and he carried her up the hill
He's laid her down on a railroad track just an hour ahead of the train
And Jesse knew that soon the 12:05 would take the blame

And then he went to town and he waited around till he thought the time was right
And he told the law how the 12:05 had taken his lady's life
The sheriff just looked at Jesse hard, said you better tell the truth this time
Because the 12:05 just jumped the track about 10 miles up the line

And no one knows what caused the train to leave the tracks that night
It never happened before or since but it served old Jesse right
You can still hear the train whistle whine as it passes by this way
But the 12:05 won't ever take the blame for Jesse Clay
No, the 12:05 won't ever take the blame for Jesse Clay",Jessie Clay And The 12:05,I Just Came Home To Count The Memories,1981,10,,Track 'B4',Album,False
502,N/A,John Anderson,"Down a trail of time there's many sorrows
And a worried mind can't be at rest
For everything I've ever wanted
I do not find but I've done my best

I can see the stars in the wild blue yonder
And I count each one up in the sky
I've got them named and when I come to yours dear
I remember things and I start to cry

Down the trail of time the way is crooked
I've left behind many pleasures too
I've also left my share of sorrows
And that is why I feel so blue

I remember two blue eyes that loved me
In a thousand years I couldn't forget
I left alone to face the future
Sometimes I wish we'd never met",Trail Of Time,I Just Came Home To Count The Memories,1981,10,,Track 'B5',Album,False
