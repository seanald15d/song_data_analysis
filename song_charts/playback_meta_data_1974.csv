0,1,Tom T. Hall,"I love little baby ducks, old pick-up trucks, slow-moving trains, and rain
I love little country streams, sleep without dreams, Sunday school in may,
And hay
And I love you too

I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends, birds in the world, and squirrels
I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups, old TV shows,
And snow
And I love you too

I love honest open smiles, kisses from a child, tomatoes on the vine, and onions
I love winners when they cry, losers when they try, music when it's good, and light

In downtown Birmingham

Right away I bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smokin' into New Orleans

Just help me get to Houston town
There are people there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down

And put luggage in my hand

Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon lies heavy

Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey it's good to be back home again

How you've spent your time
And what's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday
Sunshine made her cry
And you felt the baby move just yesterday

Hey it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend

And all the time that I can lay this tired old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for
The love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of
Just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home

And for making my own bed this week - one dollar
And for going to the store - fifty cents
An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping
Twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash - one dollar
Getting a good report card - five dollars
And for raking the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen seventy-five.

And a thousand memories flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over,
This is what I wrote:

For nine months I carried you
Growing inside me - no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you,
Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge
For the time and the tears.
And the cost through the years, there's no charge

The full cost of my love is no charge.

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead - no charge
For advice and the knowledge
And the cost of your college - no charge
For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose
There's NO CHARGE, son

The full cost of my love, is - charge.

I see the sparkling little diamond on your hand
It's plain to see that you've already got a man
I can see you're not about to fall for any of my lies
I see the want to in your eyes.

Deep in your smile there's a quiet, soft desire
Like the embers of a once raging fire
You know I could light that fire again, you know it isn't wise
I see the want to in your eyes.

How strong's a band of gold.
Is it strong enough to hold,
When a love has grown cold
And A woman wants a love, sweet and warm.

How many women just like you have silent schemes?
How many men like me do they sleep with in their dreams?
You can stay or you can go and although I sympathize 
I still see the want to in your eyes.

With a one-eyed snake and a three-legged dog

Give me a little a little charm that'll make me rich

Give me a million dollars and I tell you what I'll do

Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled, and she said Hey, Hey
I'm getting ready for my wedding day
But old handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie

Of joy-filled tears, yet death-like pain,
Into this wondrous world of many wonders

That same woman's face was wrapped up
In a raptured look of love and tenderness,
As she marvelled at the soft and warm,
And cuddly boy child feeding at her breast.

And she said,""Hello country bumpkin,
Fresh as frost down on the pumpkin;
I've seen some sights, but babe you're somethin',
Mama loves her country bumpkin""

And peaceful country place,

The raptured wonder from the woman's face;

Her race was nearly run,

The sad eyes of her husband and her son.

And a quilt of patch work cotton
A place to lay your body down was that big four poster bed

Daddy built it out of pine two days before the wedding
They say the neighbours cheered and hollered till his face got red
And Mama brought the feather pillows and some handmade bedding
And they spent their wedding night in that big four poster bed
That night they swore like that bed their love would last forever
And they'd ask no more of life than the simple things they had
So they planned there future as they laid close together
And later I was born there in that big four poster bed

It was just some boards of rough cut pine
And a quilt of patch work cotton
A place to lay your body down, a place to rest your head
A field of fluffy mountains for a little girl to hide in
Clouds and chasing rainbows was that big four poster bed

I remember as a child waking up on a winter morning
With Sound of laughing voices and the smell of baking bread
And running across that coal wood floor jumping there with them
And Lord, I felt so safe and warm in that big four poster bed

The day that Daddy died, he whispered something soft to mama
To this day she's never told a soul the words he said
She just smiled through her tears and held his hand and nodded
And my Daddy looked so much at rest in that big four poster bed

It was just some boards of rough cut pine
And a quilt of patchwork cotton

Fear that is within you now that seems to never end

Where's the rhyme and where's the reason?

To seek the wisdom of the children
And the graceful way of flowers in the wind

Like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow
They're a promise of the future and a blessing for today

The sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea
It is written: ""From the desert to the mountains they shall lead us""
By the hand and by the heart, they will comfort you and me
In their innocence and trusting, they will teach us to be free

To lay me down with a smiling face comes a little bit higher.

Seeking grace in every step he takes

The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

It brought us close together,
I guess it broke her heart,
But it opened up the space for us to be,
What a lovely place, a lovely space to be.

He came passin' through one dark, gloomy day 
And I considered myself as lucky 
When he told me he would take me away 
And though he was older, it made me no difference 
His promise of riches was all I could see 
At last I could leave the coal mines of Kentucky 
And know something better than sad poverty

But there are other places in the world I'd like to see

But I'll always hold you in my memory 

But I've never adjusted to sociable livin' 
The friends that he knows, they're all strangers to me 
Thousands of miles from Blackie, Kentucky 
In a mansion with a husband that never loved me 

He won't let my family and friends come to visit 
Because they are country and poor, he's ashamed 
Oh, but I'd give my life, Lord, if I could just go see them 
All that's changed about me is my name 

Blackie, Kentucky, oh Lord, how I miss you 
If I could come back home, I'd never leave you anymore 
I'd like to see my poor, hardworking, coal-minin' Daddy 
And Mama, and the kids, and the friends I knew before 

My world is as black as the coal in Kentucky 
He won't let me leave him - there's no way to win 
I'll take my own life, dear God, please forgive me 
But I've got to get back home to Blackie once again 

An' I've left him a note, in the mornin' he'll find it 
It's my last request and he can't refuse me 
I've told him to bury me back in Blackie, Kentucky 
Where my family and my friends can come and visit me 

Blackie, Kentucky I'm comin' home to you 
But different from the way you remember me before

The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.

I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.

Little girls and boys played happy games
Everything I ever cared about is gone now

How's it going and I said fine
The expression on his face would make me think
He could almost read my mind

If the kids could come and play
Lord I wish I could have told him yes but I
Just said I guess son not today

Aren't singing like they did when we were here

In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain there was no need
She'd smile in Mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from sellin' a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well - the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we worked hard

It's another hungry mouth to feed

Do we simply turn our heads

Plays in the street as the cold wind blows

He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far

Step on in, ya don't have to play to win

608,N/A,Gordon Lightfoot,"It was only yesterday
When I heard the teacher say
Patiently, one and two make three
We were children, you and me
Let us pray for the ones they call
The children of today 
Nothin' left but promises
Nothin' much is certain
All we see is want and need across the board, why thank you lord
We're livin' in the glory of your care
Skies of blue have all turned brown
To the sound of cryin
Lord abide, let us stem the tide
Of broken dreams
Sometimes you seem to tell us
It's too late for prayin' 

See the ocean wild and blue
Think of all that's in her
She will not surrender to the likes of us, but then she must
They tell us, wise men tell us, it's too late
For each child with eyes that smile
There'll be ten more cryin'
Lord abide, let us stem the time
Of helplessness
But then I guess we're livin'
Is it too late for prayin' 

Nothin' here but grains of sand
Nothin' much worth savin'
Guess we've all got problems of our own to bear, and still we share
Tomorrow could get better than today
To the ones who've loved in vain
Will ya be beholden
Lord abide, let us stem the tide
Of broken dreams
Sometimes ya seem to tell us
It's too late for prayin'",Too Late For Prayin',Sundown,1974,10,3:00,Track 'B5',Album,False
609,N/A,Brenda Lee,"I'm just a penny that fell from a hole in ya pocket
And clattered to the gutter at your feet
I'm like a puppet on a broken string who lies completely helpless in a heap
Just a hopeful heart standing in line hoping you might need me sometime
If ya ya do you might call my name

But from now on I guess I'll always be that somethin' you saved
For a rainy day that never came

'Cause you've got sunshine and fields of clover
But I feel so useless now that it's over
You never said you'd leave me or that you didn't love me
And I guess you're gonna keep me on a string

You'd mean a thing to me,

You gave me love

Sweet country babe,
The memories are clear.
And I remember the laughter
Sure miss the laughter.
Heaven, you were here.

The girl you used to be...
And I have heard all the stories.
You know the stories
Don't mean a thing to me.

I love your face,
I love your quiet ways.
If I could paint you a color
You'd be a rainbow
On a summer day.

Unless she wants things to go her way
Cause time and time again I've tried to leave her

And it hurts because she knows the words to say
When she hears me cleaning out my drawers and closet
She says just enough to make me stay

Sometimes I wonder how I've stayed this long
Like a fool I keep hanging round for more
When she acts like I'm already gone
Until I start to walk out the door then like before

And she knows I need it more and more each day
And when she sees I can't take it any longer
