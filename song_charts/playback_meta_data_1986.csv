I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me

Have found you another

That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'Cause you just don't love me no more

Did you think I could hate you

Now come on you know me too well

How could I hurt you
When darling I love you

10,11,Kenny Rogers,"One time I drove to see a girl across the country
One night as I was driving through New Mexico
I had the windows wide open
It was cold and I was crying
And I laid her letter on the radio
Then I stopped outside of Tahoe
Through this tiny mining town
At a diner to refill for the ride
And in the wind I heard this crying
Like a heart broke right in two
I turned my collar up and went inside

Well, I saw this smiling waitress
Joshing friendly with these truckers
They'd give her pats and she'd give them shoves
I said: ""Miss, what's that awful crying?""
Everybody laughed and said
""It's the Tomb of the Unknown Love""
And then they pointed out the window to this stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside a hill
And on that winter night, I read these words alone
These words that are haunting me still
It said:

Here lies a young man struck down in his prime
By the awesome burning power of love
He couldn't stand his true love cheatin'
So he shot the girl down
They hung him from that tree up above
I know that local folks say it's the wind
But I know it's crying
From the Tomb of the Unknown Love

So I drove on to my destination
I did the job my heart commanded of me
And when the sheriff sirens came
I didn't even try to fight
They counted ten, I came out at three
So now I guess tomorrow morning
Warden reads some kind of paper
How I'm gonna pay the state for what I've done
Hey, then they'll put the shackles on me
And we'll take a little walk
They won't have to drag me 'cause it's said and done
And maybe someday they can put me up a stone
All by itself, beneath the tree, beside the hill
And lovers everywhere can come and read along
These words that will give them a chill
And it'll say:

Cadillac smiles in the ladies' styles in this world
They ain't no part of me
A hundred dollar bill can cure your ills in this world
But it ain't no good to me

You see money and clothes are easily burned
People and cars are easily turned around
I'm looking for something that'll last me all of my life
I'm listening for the sound

I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Everynight of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine

A woman trying to find a diamond mine
Ain't my kind, she ain't no use to me
A big estate with a wrought-iron gate
A mansion on the hill, ain't where I wanna be

You see without love a house ain't a home
A diamond ain't no more than a stone in the ground

Climbs a strong and aging face
Wants to make some honest pay
Losing to the rainstorm
He's got two strong legs to guide him
Two strong arms keep him alive

Running scared now forced to hide
In a land where he once stood with pride

Singing songs of passion

The summer was the killer
Between our hearts and minds
Every day a drama
Dragging by in quarter time

By summer it was over
I couldn't see it through
Trying not to lose my mind

Don't know if I've changed at all
But I'm in love with you again

Trying to find the truth inside
Instead of getting by on dreams

In summer we were blinded
We thought it couldn't last
Crying 'bout the future
And fighting 'bout the past

Of a little run-down cabin in the woods
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.

When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.
We lived our day-today in plain dirt fashion,
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.

But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,
And somewhere in between I must have grown
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.
Now I know, it's a long hard road

Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,
When the sun-up came, we got up and went
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent
Singin' songs along with Gramma's radio.

Livin' in my memories all in vain
'Cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.

Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.

When you love the feeling, it begins to rust
Just when the sun is shining, clouds set in
I still feel the shadow of your distant friend.

I still feel the past each time you touch me
Will the fire in your mind never end
I'm so afraid our love may turn to ashes
I still feel the shadow of your distant friend.

You know I really love you, but your heart's confused
By that aching fever that keeps haunting you
Just when I think it's over, it starts again
I still feel the shadow of your distant friend...",The Shadow Of Your Distant Friend,Will The Wolf Survive,1986,10,2:44,Track 'B3',Album,False
386,N/A,Waylon Jennings,"I've got me a woman she's a pretty good woman at that
We live with a monkey and a Chinese acrobat
She calls me Tex and makes me wear a cowboy hat
But I don't care 'cause she's a pretty good woman at that

I like nothin' better than to spend my nights at home
Listen to my baby when she plays my slide trombone
She talks in tongues, boy that really turns me on
With a woman like that, a man need never to roam

Some folks get themselves together
Some folks stay in Tennessee
But I don't care where I'm goin'
Just as long as that woman stays with me

Nothin' in the world'd make me treat that woman mean
She shaves my beard and she keeps my tractor clean
She burns my food, makes me eat turnip greens
But I don't care 'cause she's the best little woman I've seen

Some folks get themselves together
Some folks stay in Tennessee
But I don't care where I'm goin'
Just as long as that woman stays with me",I've Got Me A Woman,Will The Wolf Survive,1986,10,4:01,Track 'B4',Album,False
387,N/A,Waylon Jennings,"About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

L asked if I could have one someday when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
Really blew up, I didn't understand
Mama said,""The pistol is the devil's right hand""

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said,""The pistol
Is the devil's right hand

My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
Loads a mite slow and soon I found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out

So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
Called a Peacemaker but I never knew why
Never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama said, ""The pistol is the devil's right hand""

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said, ""The pistol
Is the devil's right hand""

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said, ""The pistol
Is the devil's right hand""

Well I get into a card game in a company town
Caught a miner cheating, I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, I watched the man fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw

The trial was in the morning and they [Incomprehensible] me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, ""Not guilty"" I said
""Not guilty"", I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Mama said,""The pistol
Is the devil's right hand""

The devil's right hand
The devil's right hand
Nothing touched the trigger
But the devil's right hand

There's so much about love that I don't know
I can't believe I didn't recognize
Real love when it looked me in the eyes

There's an empty pillow on my bed
And you've always got a place to lay your head
This old room sure is a gloomy place
Cept the wall that holds the picture of your angel face

391,N/A,John Conlee,"I lost my job down at the docks
My old Chevy is up on blocks
And I've got holes in both my socks
But she loves me

The ol' washing machine still squeaks
And our hot water heater leaks
And I ain't worked in fourteen weeks
But she loves me

And she loves my troubles away
Every night she makes my day
Troubles get me down but they never stay
'Cause she loves my troubles away

And I can't give her fancy things
Pretty clothes and diamond rings
Nor the pleasure money brings
'Cause she loves my troubles away

Late at night she takes my hand
Says, you know, I understand
You just do the best you can
Then she loves me

And she loves my troubles away
Every night she makes my day
Troubles get me down but they never stay
'Cause she loves my troubles away

392,N/A,Sawyer Brown,"Alone in her room
Got on his favorite perfume
But she's goin' nowhere
She took a chance
And saved the last dance
Oh, but he doesn't care
She's a lonely girl
She's a lonely girl

She calls on the phone
Seems he isn't home
So she watches TV
She's gettin' bored
With being ignored
Oh, she's startin' to see
She's a lonely girl
She's a lonely girl

And lonely girls don't stay lonely forever
Given the time, don't think she won't find something better
You're thinkin' now that you don't need her
But you'll find out if you leave her
A lonely girl
A lonely girl

Oh, the telephone rings 
It's the boy down the street
Says he just wants to talk
Wonders if they can meet, 'cause...

And lonely girls don't stay lonely forever
Given the time, don't think she won't find something better
You're thinkin' now that you don't need her
But you'll find out if you leave her
