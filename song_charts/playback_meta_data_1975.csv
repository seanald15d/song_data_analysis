And left 'em settin' on the scales

By the time we hit that Chi-town
Them bears was a-gettin' smart
They'd brought up some reinforcements
From the Illinois National Guard

There's armored cars and tanks and jeeps
And rigs of ev'ry size
Yeah, them chicken coops was full'a bears
And choppers filled the skies

Well, we shot the line and we went for broke
With a thousand screamin' trucks
An' eleven long-haired Friends a' Jesus
In a chartreuse micra-bus

Ah, Rubber Duck to Sodbuster, come over. Yeah, 10-4, Sodbuster? Lissen, you wanna put that micra-bus right behind that suicide jockey? Yeah, he's haulin' dynamite, and he needs all the help he can get. 

Well, we laid a strip for the Jersey shore
And prepared to cross the line
I could see the bridge was lined with bears
But I didn't have a dog-goned dime

I says, ""Pig Pen, this here's the Rubber Duck.
We just ain't a-gonna pay no toll.""

Better slow this vehicle down

All the rainbows we've been chasing in our minds
We know there's no way of making
Other ties on us unravel and unwind

And today's the day the first installment's due
For the rest of all my days I'll wonder why
The maker mismatched me and you

Will need and want my love just like you do

Let's ask him to please play one last final tune

She was shy and had a fear, of things she did not know
But we got it on together in such a super way
We held each other close at night, and traded dreams each day
She said Rocky I've never been in love before, don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you take my hand I might get through it, through it
I said baby, oh sweet baby it's love that sets us free
And God knows if the world should end your love is safe with me

We found an old grey house, and you would not believe the way
We worked at night to fix it up, took classes in the day
Painting walls and sipping wine, sleeping on the floor
With so much love with just too, soon we found there'd be one more

And she said Rocky I've never had a baby before, don't know if I can do it
But if you let me lean on you, take my hand I might get through it, through it
I said baby, oh sweet baby it's love that sets us free,
And God knows if the word should end your love is save with me.

We had lots of problems then, but we had lots of fun
Like the birthday party, when our baby girl turned one
I was proud and satisfied, life had so much to give
Till the day they told me that she didn't have long to live
She said Rocky I never had to die before don't know if I can do it

Now it's back to two again my little girl and I
Who looks so much like her sweet mother, sometimes that makes me cry
I sleep alone at nights again, I walk alone each day
And sometimes when I'm about to give in, I hear her sweet voice say to me

Rocky you know you've been alone before, you know you can do it
But if you'd like to lean on me, take my hand I'll help you through it, through it.

And he played something stately and slow

Change in awhile so she learned
How to drink and she learned how to smile

Was just a little bit to strong

As far as I can see,
There great white wave shines through the night,
On lonely guys like me.

The cabaret's and honky tonks,
The flashing signs and lights,
The broken heart to lose itself,
In the glow of city lights.

Lights that say forgive her now,
In a glass of sherry wine,
The lights that offer other girls,
For empty hearts like mine.

They paint a pretty picture,
Of a world that's gay and bright,
And it's just a mask for lonliness,
Behind those city lights.

The world was dark,
God made the stars to brighten up the night,
But the guy that put those stars above,
I don't believe he made those lights.

It's just a place for me to cry,
When things don't turn out right,
Just a place to run away and hide,
Behind those city lights.

Lights that say forget her love,
In a different atmosphere,
Lights that lure are nothing but
A masquerade for tears.

Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine

She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime.

She sold you Paper Roses, But they only cost a dime.

Trembling hand as she passed the rose
Red Crepe paper, made nature's bouquet

I took the rose from her trembing hand
With eyes of age, she smilled and walked away
Like a breath of spring I could smell the rose
It came alive and I heard her say.

Buy my Roses, pretty roses
They're only made of paper
But they only cost a dime.

You say that you want me

Yes, I really want you

Well, how much do you want me?

Well, I want you as much as a child wants it's mother
Oh, that's how much I want you

And you say that you need me 

Yes, I really need you
Well, how much do you need me?

I'll tell you how much can a man need a woman?
Well, that's how much I need you



Then what will you give me?

What will I give you?

Yes, what will you give me?

A garden of love that will live on forever
Oh, that's what I will give you

524,N/A,Tammy Wynette,"I'll need time
To get you off my mind
And I may sometimes bother you
Try to be in touch with you
Even ask too much of you
From time to time.

Now and then
Lord, you know I'll need a friend
Till I get to use to losing you
Let me keep on using you
Till I can make it on my own.

I'll get by
But no matter how I try
There'll be times you know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all
From time to time.

But they say
Oh, there'll be a brighter day
But till then I'll lean on you
That's all I mean to do
Till I can make it on my own.

Surely someday I'll wake up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you
And all my cryin's done
No more hurting memories can find me.

But till then
Lord, you know I'm gonna need a friend
Till I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
Till I can make it on my own.

All my friends told me, we'd never make it
That love to you was just a game you played
And I'll admit at times we had rough goin'
But in each other's arms we loved it away


And I've been told, my love could never hold you
To tie it down's a price you'd never pay
And I'll admit there's times when you got restless
But in each other's arms we loved it away

Step by step we walked the road together
Hand in hand love grew more everyday
When trouble came we held on to each other
And in each other's arms we loved it away
