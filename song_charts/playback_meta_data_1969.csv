Times were hard and things were bad.
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud.
Just poor people, that's all we were.
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt.
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud.

Daddy sang bass,
Mama sang tenor.
Me and little brother would join right in there.
Singing seems to help a troubled soul.
One of these days and it won't be long.
I'll rejoin them in a song.
I'm gonna join the family circle at the Throne.
No, the circle won't be broken.

Now I remember after work,
Mama would call in all of us.
You could hear us singing for a country mile.
Now little brother has done gone on.
But, I'll rejoin him in a song.
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while.

1,2,Johnny Cash,"Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze

Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me Sue

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks
Seems I had to fight my whole life through

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame

But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man that give me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew

At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table dealin' stud
Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn out picture that my mother had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye

He was big and bent and grey and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said
""My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!""
Yeah!  That's what I told him

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down but to my surprise
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear

I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile

Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong""

Yeah!  He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and ya got the right
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do

But you oughta thank me before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue""
Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun
Called him my Pa and he called me his son
And I come away with a different point of view

And I think about him now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George, any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!",A Boy Named Sue,A Boy Named Sue / San Quentin,1969,2,3:40,Track 'A',Single,True

With thunder crashing in my head

A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out

Together we'll find a brand new mommy

It's cruel, somehow

It hurts my little children so

7,8,Bobbie Gentry,"Well, I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer that I turned eighteen.
We lived in a one-room, run down shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans.

We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard-pressed
When Momma spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress.

Well, Momma washed and combed and curled my hair,
Then she painted my eyes and lips.
Then I stepped into the satin dancin' dress.
It was split in the side clean up to my hips.

It was red, velvet-trimmed, and it fit me good
And starin' back from the lookin' glass
Was a woman
Where a half grown kid had stood.

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out girl it's up to you.
Now get on out, you better start sleepin' uptown.""

Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck and she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears welling up
In her troubled eyes when she started to speak

She looked at our pitiful shack and then
She looked at me and took a ragged breath
""Your Pa's runned off, and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death.""

She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-healed shoe

It sounded like somebody else was talkin'
Askin', ""Momma what do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy.
They'll be nice to you.""

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out, well it's up to you
Now get on out, girl, you better start movin' uptown.""

Well, that was the last time I saw my momma
When I left that rickety shack
'Cause the welfare people came and took the baby.
Momma died and I ain't been back.

But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no other way out.
It wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my momma was talkin' 'bout.

I knew what I had to do.
But I made myself this solemn vow:
That I was gonna to be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how.

I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame.
I mighta been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name.

""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.

Wasn't long after that a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
One week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five roomed penthouse suite.

Since then I've charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
And I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat.

Now I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites that would call me bad.
They criticize Momma for turning me out
No matter how little we had.

And though I haven't had to worry 'bout nothin'
Now for nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation
In my poor mommas voice ringin' in my ears.

""Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down!
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord forgive me for what I do,
But if you want out well it's up to you.
Now get on out, you better move uptown.

The biggest thing that happensá is the county fair,
I guess that's why it seemed likeá such a big event,

Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die,
But she lived long enough for her to testify.

Walter Browning was a happyá married man,
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand,
But it was gone, nobody kneW just where it went,
He lost it in the Carroll County accident.

Mary Ellen testified that he flagged her down,
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town,
No one ever doubted what she said was true,
'Cause she was well respected in the county too.

I went down to see the wreck like all the rest,
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess,
But I found something no one else had ever seen,
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine.

A little match box circled by a rubber band,
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand,
It took awhile to figure out just what it meant,
The truth about the Carroll County accident.

Well, they said,""tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go.""

I thought I'd be there overnight so I just called my boss
To tell him I'd be off but not for long

Well, they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys
One little barred up window in the rear
My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in
We ought to send the jailer for some beer

Well, I had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge
And the jailer's job was not the best in town
Later on his wife brought hot bologna, eggs and gravy
The first day I was there I turned it down

Well, next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early
Wonderin' when I'd get my release


Later on we got more hot bologna, eggs and gravy
And by now I wasn't quite so hard to please

Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten
The sheriff came in chewin' on a straw
He said, ""where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis? 
I'd like to talk to him about the law.""
Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady
And I really should be gettin' on my way
That part about me bein' who I was did not impress him
He said, ""the judge'll be here any day.""

The jailer had a wife and let me tell you she was awful
But she brought that hot bologna every day
And after seven days she got to lookin' so much better
I asked her if she'd like to run away

The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away.

Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung,
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do.
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly quickly died.
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play.

To someone else at the time
But lonely look in women
Are a weakness of mine.

So I bought all she said about the love
He never gave her
And figured I just love her some
And do us both a favor.

Just as I got up to leave
He walked through the door
And I guess I thought he'd be surprised
But he looked at me as if to say
He's been there before
And he offered me these words to the wise.

He said, you know she's a cheater son
But you believe that you're the one
Who's got a lot of what it takes to change her
And I know now that you can't get her
You ain't much but that don't matter
Nothing suits her better than a stranger.

And the stranger man the better
And the chances are she'll set her
Eyes on you the next time she goes slummin'
So you sit back and wait your turn, boy
You got lots of times to learn, boy
Cool it while you can, your time's comin'.

Well, it happens that in time
It happened just like he said
And soon enough her shoes
Were settin' under my bed.

And I'll confess I did my best
To prove that man had lied
But nothing short of suicide
Could keep her satisfied.

So buddy, losing her to you
Was just a matter of time
And it's her time for finding something new
Nothing I can say is gonna
Make you change your mind
So I'll just give the same advice to you.

You know she's a cheater son
But you believe that you're the one

334,N/A,Johnny Cash,"And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil.

It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row.
And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold.
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul.
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar.

My thirsty wanted whisky; my hungry needed beans,
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream.
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams,
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar.

Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern:
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor;
Friendly shadows.

I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar.
And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar.
An' he turned and said: ""Come up here boy, and show us what you are.""
I said: ""I'm dry."" He bought me a beer.

He nodded at my guitar and said: ""It's a tough life, ain't it?""
I just looked at him. He said: ""You ain't makin' any money, are you?""
I said: ""You've been readin' my mail.""
He just smiled and said: ""Let me see that guitar.
""I've got something you oughta hear.""
Then he laid it on me:

""If you waste your time a-talkin' to the people who don't listen,
""To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear.
""And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about,
""Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care?""

There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind,
Who were crucified for what they tried to show.
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time.
'Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know.

Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before,
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door.
When no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor,
And lonesome was more than a state of mind.

You see, the devil haunts a hungry man,
If you don't wanna join him, you got to beat him.
I ain't sayin' I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing.
Then I stole his song.

And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen,
To the things that I am sayin', prayin' someone's gonna hear.
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about,
Are things they could be changin', hopin' someone's gonna care.

I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same,
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul.
And if I never have a nickel, I won't ever die ashamed.

And his hands could form a table true enough to stand forever
And he might have spun his life out in the coolness of the mornings
But he put aside his tools and he walked the burning highways
To build a house from folks like you and me

And he found them as they wandered through the wild Judean mountains
And he found them as they pulled their nets upon the Sea of Galilee
And for a thousand evenings while the day behind him emptied
He walked among the poor and he stopped to touch the dying
And he built his house from people just like these

It was on a shining Sunday when he rode to old Jerusalem
And the palms they cast before him were the crimes they laid against him
It was on a stormy Friday when he climbed the streets of Calvary
And where he died today why they're sellin' beads and postcards
And they tell us too that that was long ago

But would he stand today upon the sands of California
Or walk the sweating blacktop in New York and Mississippi
Where the mighty churches rise above the screaming cities
Would he be a guest on Sunday a vagrant on a Monday
With the doors locked tight against his kind you know

Come again now Jesus be a carpenter among us
There are chapels in our discontent cathedrals in our sorrows
And we dwell in golden mansions with the sand for our foundations
And the raging water's rising and the thunder's all around us
Won't you come and build a house on rock again

Where I was paneled by twelve honest men

Holding the verdict in his right hand

And I don't guess I'll ever live it down
I was sittin' at a red light when these two men came and got me
And said that I was speeding through their town

Well, they said,""tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go.""
They let me call one person on the phone
I thought I'd be there overnight so I just called my boss
To tell him I'd be off but not for long

Well, they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys

My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in
We ought to send the jailer for some beer

Well, I had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge
And the jailer's job was not the best in town
Later on his wife brought hot bologna, eggs and gravy
The first day I was there I turned it down

Well, next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early
Wonderin' when I'd get my release


Later on we got more hot bologna, eggs and gravy
And by now I wasn't quite so hard to please

Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten
The sheriff came in chewin' on a straw
He said, ""where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis? 
I'd like to talk to him about the law.""
Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady
And I really should be gettin' on my way
That part about me bein' who I was did not impress him
He said, ""the judge'll be here any day.""

But she brought that hot bologna every day
And after seven days she got to lookin' so much better
I asked her if she'd like to run away

Of rocket ships and Mars
Of sunny days
And Willie Mays
And chocolate candy bars

Dream on, little Broomstick Cowboy
Dream while you can
Of big green frogs
And puppy dogs
And castles in the sand

For, all too soon you'll awaken
Your toys will all be gone
Your broomstick horse will ride away
To find another home
And you'll have grown into a man
With cowboys of your own
And then you'll have to go to war
To try and save your home

And then you'll have to learn to hate
You'll have to learn to kill
It's always been that way, my son
I guess it always will
No broomstick gun they'll hand you
No longer you'll pretend
You'll call some man your enemy
You used to call him 'friend'
And when the rockets thunder
You'll hear your brothers cry
And through it all you'll wonder
Just why they had to die

So dream on, little Broomstick Cowboy
Dream while you can
For soon, you'll be a dreadful thing:
My son, you'll be a man",Broomstick Cowboy,Muddy Mississippi Line,1969,12,3:15,Track 'B6',Album,False

I wanna go home I wanna go home oh Lord I wanna go home

Now the homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm just fine
By day I make the cars and by night I'm a makin' the bars
Lord if only they could read between the lines
As you know I rode a long black freight train way up north to Detroit City
But after all these years I find that well I've just been wastin' my time
But you know what I think I'm gonna do folks I'm gonna take my foolish pride

And home isn't some place to go just to feel all alone that's not home

He laied to rest one afternoon and never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe to dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours and I guess we must've drunk a case of beer
I guess I oughta go and watch them put him down but I don't own the suit
And anyway when they start talkin' about the fire and hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck and act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway when they're all through I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Here they come and who's that ridin' in that big ole shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome I do believe that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his rich Uncle someone said he owned a big ole farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down and look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car and would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress you know some women do look good in black
He's not even in the ground and they say that his track is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard but you can't tell too much behind a veil
Listen ain't that pretty when the bugler plays the military taps

Look forward to tomorrow everything seems right
Seems like I'm a smilin' from my hat down to my shoes
My baby loves me and no blues is good news

Well I used to be as lonely as a motherless child
It took every muscle in my body to smile
I got a funny feeling like I ain't never had
I tingle all over and a part of me feels bad

The misery and the loneliness that I've known before
Just makes me appreciate my baby that much more
When I come home there's kissin' my pipe and my house shoes
My baby loves me and no blues is good news

I tip my hat to children as I I go on my way
