(Big John)

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood 6 foot 6 and weighed 245 
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew you didn't give no lip
To Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much he's kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all you just said ""hi"" to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fella to the Promised Land, Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast 
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber and gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree just stood there alone
Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out, ""There's a light up above.""
And 20 men scrambled from a would be grave
And now there's only one left down there to save
Big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And as smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line
For Big John

(Big John)
(Big John)
Big Bad John
(Big John)

Now they never reopened that worthless pit 
They just placed a marble stand in front of it
These few words are written on that stand
""At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man...

Big Sam left Seattle in the year of '92
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too

Said, ""Sam you're a lookin' at a lonely, lonely man

For one small band of golden place on sweet little Jenny's hand

Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelery in hock.

To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.

Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: ""Don't stop.""

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.

And my heart's as cold as the ice and snow that fills these walkin' shoes.
That old smoke-stack keeps barkin' back to me and seems to say:
We'll carry you on, oh, Restless One.

I had mushed my way on a Husky sleigh, to the land of Midnight Sun;
And I kissed the squaw at the wigwam door, many times I faced a gun.
Brown Eskimo didn't want me to go, when I told her I must run.
And she gave me the name of the Restless One.

Then I strolled into a tavern in that frozen land afar;
Where I met a beautiful Indian maid, she was known as the Morning Star.
Her eyes were bright like the Northern Lights, when they chase the Arctic moon.
And I knew she was born for the Restless One.

As we danced I gently kissed her in the path of the morning sun;
Love was sweet and oh, so blissful, with a romance just begun.
The Restless One had gone and fell in love with the Yukon Queen.
And she fell in love with the Restless One.

Through the door came an angry red-skin, on his head was a beaded band;
I was courtin' the wife of an Indian chief, who ruled with an iron hand.
With a knife he run, but I pulled my gun and I shot him to the floor. 
Then the hunt began for the Restless One.

Many days and nights they trailed me out under the northern sky;
Where the wild birds song was mournful and the timber wolf did cry.
But they tracked me down and I'm 'Frisco bound, I've made my final run.

My Ebony Eyes was coming to me
From out of the skies on Flight 1203
In an hour or two, I would whisper ""I do""
To my beautiful Ebony Eyes

spoken:
The plane was way overdue,
So I went inside to the airline's desk and I said:
""Sir, I wonder why 1203 is so late""
He said: ""Oh they probably took off late,
Or they may have run into some turbulent weather and had to alter the course""

I went back outside and waited at the gate
And I watched the beacon light from the control tower
As it whipped through the dark ebony skies if it were searching for -
My Ebony Eyes

And then came the announcement over the loudspeaker,
""Would those having relatives or friends on Flight number 1203
Please report to the chapel across the street at once""

Then I felt a burning break deep inside
And I knew the heavenly ebony skies
Had taken my life's most wonderful prize
My beautiful Ebony Eyes

If I ever get, to heaven I'll bet
The first angel I'll recognise
She'll smile at me and I know she will be

Carved out of rock and stone, iron and wood

The tears led to a quarrel, love disappeared

A village in old Mexico
A girl and a Mexican soldier
Were sweethearts, a long time ago
They made big plans for a wedding
The town of Renosa would go
And there would see Jimmy Martinez
Married to Sarah Sero

One day there came a message
It said that Jimmy must go
As Jimmy was leavin' Renosa
To fight at the Alamo
He never returned to Renosa

How Jimmy the Mexican soldier
Died at the Alamo

Jimmy's last letter to Sarah
Began with a message like this
Oh dear one, how sweet is the memory
The memory of our parting kiss
I send my heart in this letter
I pray to the one up above
Oh Sarah, don't ever forget me
Stay just as pure as the dove
Oh-oh-oh

It's chosen just one mate for life
And you are the one I have chosen
The one that I want for my wife

A small little candle would burn
Years turned her dark hair to silver

A deck of cards. During a North African campaign a bunch of soldier boys
Had been on a long hike, and they arrived in a little town called
Casino""

The next morning being Sunday several of the boys went to church. A
Sargent commanded the boys in church, and after the Chaplain had read the
Prayer the text was taken up next... Those of the boys who had a prayer book
Took them out, but this one boy only had a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out

The Sergeant saw the cards and said,""Soldier, put away those cards""

After the services were over the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sargent, why have you brought this man here?""

""For playing cards in church, sir""

""And what have you to say for yourself, son?""

""Much, sir."" replied the soldier

'The Marshall said, ""I hope so, for if not, I shall punish you more than
Any man was ever punished""

The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on a march for about six days, and I had neither Bible nor Prayer Book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions""

With that the boy started his story

""You see, Sir, when I look at the Ace it reminds me that there is but one God. The deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into two parts; the Old and New Testaments. And when I see the trey I think of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When I see the four I think of the four evangelist who preached the Gospel. There was Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And when I see the five it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps. Ten of 'em; five who were wise and were saved; five were foolish and were shut out. And when I see the six it
Reminds me that in six days God made this great heaven and earth. And when
I see the seven it reminds me that on the seventh day God rested from His
Great work. When I see the eight I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when he destroyed this earth. There was Noah, his wife, their three sons, and their wives. And when I see the nine I think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine of the ten didn't even thank Him. When I see the ten I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on a tablet of stone. When I see the King it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I see the queen I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary who is Queen of Heaven. And the jacks, or knaves, it's the devil. And when I count the number of spots on a deck of cards I find three hundred sixty-five the number of days in a year. Fifty-two cards, the number of weeks in a year. Four suits, the number of weeks in a month. Twelve picture cards, the number of months in a year. Thirteen tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter.

I was going home again
My Indian bride was by my side
When I rode in to Guthrie

Big Jim Brady ran the town, the saloon and gambling hall
The general store and several more, he ran them all in Guthrie
With the horses tied I went inside and was buying fresh supplies
Outside the door I heard a rifle roar to my surprise in Guthrie
I rushed outside and my wife cried, Jim Brady's been around
He was like a fiend, both drunk and mean
So I shot him down in Guthrie

I quickly run and grabbed the gun and stood where Big Jim lay
Those who came gave me the blame so I ran away from Guthrie
I knew my bride was justified in such a circumstance
But an Indian's word would not be heard
She'd have no chance in Guthrie

All through the night I rode with fright through hills and chaparral
But the marshall knew this country too
He was on my trail from Guthrie
When noon was high he was drawing nigh, I heard his six-gun ring
Then the marshall by the badge he wore I'll see you swing in Guthrie

So now I dwell in a prison cell and an Indian girl will cry

Fame and fortune had passed him by but we never saw him frown
As day by day in his kindly way he'd serve us one and all
Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small

But old Doc Brown didn't seem to mind he didn't even send out bills
His only ambition was to find it seemed sure cures for aches and ills
Why nearly half the folks in my home town, yes I'm one of them too
Were ushered in by Old Doc Brown when we made our first debut

Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he'd receive a fee
He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he
So when the depression hit our town and drained each meager purse
The scanty income of Old Doc Brown just went from bad to worse

He had to sell his furniture, why he couldn't even pay his office rent
So to a dusty room over a livery stable Doc Brown and his satchel went
On the hitchin' post at the curb below to advertise his wares
He nailed a little sign that read Doc Brown has moved upstairs

There he kept on helping folks get well and his heart was just pure gold
But anyone with eyes could see that Doc was getting old
And then one day he didn't even answer when they knocked upon his door
Old Doc Brown was layin' down but his soul was no more

They found him there in that old black suit on his face was a smile of content
But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent
So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull
Beside each debtor's name old Doc had writ' these words: ""Paid In Full""

It looked like the potter's field for Doc and that caused us some alarm
'Til someone remembered the family graveyard out on the Simmons' farm
Old Doc had brought six of their children and Simmons was a grateful cuss
He said Doc's been like one of the family so you can let him sleep with us

Old Doc should had a funeral fine enough for king
It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing
'Cept Jones the undertaker he did mighty well
Donated an old iron casket he had never been able to sell

And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and style
But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile
And we breathed a prayer as we laid him there to rest beneath the sod
This man who'd earned the right to be on speaking terms with God

His grave was covered with flowers but not from the floral shops
Just roses and things from folks' gardens and one or two dandilion tops
For the depression had hit our little town hard and each man carried a load
So some just picked the wild flowers as they passed along the road

We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one
'Cause he'd made our town a better place for all the good he'd done
But monuments cost money so we did the best we could
And on his grave we gently placed a monument of wood

We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed his sign
And we painted it white and to all of us it certainly did look fine
Now the rains and snows have washed away our white trimmings of paint
There ain't nothin' left but Doc's own sign and that is gettin' faint

Still when southern breezes and twinkling stars caress our sleeping town
And the pale moon shines through Kentucky pines on the grave of Old Doc Brown

Is there at rest somewhere in the west that pioneer mother of mine
I'd give all I own today if someone would guide my way
To that hallowed spot where she's sleeping that pioneer mother of mine

There is nothing left of her busy life but the things she made when her days were full
A couple of rugs on the kitchen floor and an afgan knitted out of bits of wool
Her garden has a deserted look and the weeds show up in the sunshine smile she is dead
And the things she fought run wild and you stop and think was her life worth while
But if you had known as well as I knew the quiet good and the helping hand
And the neighborly warm big heart of hers I think you would really understand
That not all the people that we call great are really greatest in the end
And perhaps the finest thing in life is a homely common every day friend
So the little life with the homely tasks has worked it's pattern and so goes on
What if the weeds grow rank again and what if the flowers are dead and gone
Ah the little woman of small account with the cheerful smile on her brave old face will never die
For the tide of years will produce her like to take her place

All the sailors hearts were filled with fond regret
Looking backward to this island where they spent such happy hours
Making love to every pretty girl they've met

Well, up stopped a little sailor with his pride eyes all aglow
Saying take a look at my girl's photograph
Then the sailors gathered 'round him just to look upon her face
And he said, ""I love my Filipino baby""

She's my Filipino baby, she's my treasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Oh, her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
She's my darling little Filipino baby, oh, Jimmy

In a little rustic cottage in the port of Philippines
Dwells a lonely little maiden all alone
She is thinking of her true love though he's far across the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone

Then one day he whispered, ""Darling, I've come back
From Caroline, I've come back to claim the only girl I love""
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew
Gathered 'round and he wed his little Filipino baby

The dessert lies beneath a sky of blue
Far away, in brightest day, a ghostly sound is heard
The phantom of the rail comes into view

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On his lonely ear is fallin'
Loud and clear, just hear that lonesome wail
But it's just the ghost, the phantom of the rail

Little did he know the train was wrecked in '84
After it had crossed the Great Divide
Every year it tries again to make it just once more
If only to the California Line

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren desert fallin'
Loud and clear, just hear that lonesome wail
But it's just the ghost, the phantom of the rail

Clickity-clack along the track, it's boiler showin' red
As on it comes along the rusty rails
People that are ridin' in the cars have long been dead
Lost in time along the Phantom Trail

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren desert fallin'
Is it real to feel the very ground beneath him shake
As on it comes, the only run it ever makes

Cross here comes the phantom, as his eyes in wonder gaze
His pony shys and heads in for the brush
And as it comes upon him terror grips his heart, amazed
Leapin' to avoid it's onward rush

Hear that lonesome whistle callin'
On the barren dessert fallin'
Thought he saw the engineer, thought he heard him once more wail
As on he went, forever bent, on stayin' on the ghost train rail",Ghost Train,Jimmy Martinez / Ghost Train,1961,2,,Track 'B',Single,False
