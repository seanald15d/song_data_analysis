0,1,Brad Paisley,"If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by saying 
Look under your bed
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy 
No one else would know you hid

And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah I know you really liked her 
And it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that 
Is fast and it's rare

And oh, you got so much going for you, going right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Sticking out of your back and you're wondering if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

At the stop sign at Tomlinson and 8th
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridget 
Make sure the tank is full
On second thought, forget it
That one turns out kinda cool

Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and Dad is right
And you should really thank Ms. Brinkman
She spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath 
And she's polishing you till you shine

And oh, you got so much going for you, going right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally but you're staying home instead
Because if you fail algebra, Mom and Dad'll kill you dead
But trust me, you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

You've got so much up ahead
You'll make new friends
And you should see your kids and wife
And I'd end by saying
Have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

I guess I'll see you in the mirror 
When you're a grown man
P.S. go hug Aunt Rita 
Every chance you can

And oh, you got so much going for you, going right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd take a typing class
I wish you wouldn't worry and let it be
Hey, I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor
Like I do

I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story
Like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans

Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what ya doin' with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find

Standin' by you, waitin' at your back door

I'm the one who makes you laugh, when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs, and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?

2,3,Trace Adkins,"She was staring out the window of that SUV
Complaining, saying ""I can't wait to turn 18""
She said, ""I'll make my own money and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school""
And she kissed her head and said, ""I was just like you""

You're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times, so take a good look around
You may not know it now, but you're gonna miss this

Before she knows it, she's a brand new bride
In her one bedroom apartment and her daddy stops by
He tells her it's a nice place, she says it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
And daddy shakes his head and says ""baby, just slow down""

'Cause you're gonna miss this, you're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast

Dog's barking, phone's ringing, one kid's crying, one kid's screaming
And she keeps apologizing, he says ""they don't bother me 
I've got two babies of my own, one's 36, one's 23""
Huh, it's hard to believe

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to come around

Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes, and never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love, you had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday, who might actually treat me well

4,5,Zac Brown Band,"You know I like my chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well, I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house, it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in Southern ground

And a little bit o' chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I like to see a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Well, it's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind; this I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit o' chicken fried
An' cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well, I've seen a sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

6,7,Brad Paisley,"When you see a deer, you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake, you think picnics
And I see a largemouth up under that log

You're probably thinking that you're gonna change me
In some ways, well, maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up
Ah, but no matter what
Remember I'm still a guy

When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might
Walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around
Knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well now what can I say? At the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around
Knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed, and botoxed
With deep spray on tans and creamy, lotioney hands

I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'

On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go!"" 
And I said...

""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""

Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt""

And then they handed her a folded up flag

Of that poison, baby
Last night I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night I met a guy on the dance floor 
And I let him call me baby

And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know his last name

We left the club right around 3 o'clock 
In the morning
His Pinto sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should have been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!

Today, I woke up
Thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared
Outta nowhere
I gotta go 
Take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here
All of this will disappear
There's just one little problem:

I don't even know my last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know my last name

And one to get me through today

Say I'm comin' but there ain't no hurry
I'm havin' fun down here

He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You waitin' on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waitin' on a woman

When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waitin' on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman

And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time 'cause you don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, 'cause I don't mind

It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there?"" He said, ""Yeah, I was eleven
And times were tough, back in '35
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
A cotton farm, in the Great Depression

And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just trying to save each other
You should've seen it in color

This one here was taken overseas
In the middle of hell, in 1943
In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner, ol' Johnny McGee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back, right through the day we left

This is me and grandma in the summer sun
All dressed up, the day we said our vows
You can't tell it here, but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile, I was so proud

That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white

When it walked out your front door
Where you fell down to your knees
And can't forget the kind of suitcase
That was packed out on the sidewalk
While you cried there beggin' please
But love remembers

You can lie and tell yourself
You're over it and someone else will take love's place
And this is for the best
You can lie in that bed
In a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort
Close your eyes and still get no rest

Cause love remembers
The smell of a summer day
Lying in a hammock over fresh cut grass
And the promise of forever
Yeah love remembers
The sound of the pouring rain
Beatin' down on the top of a car
On the side of the road
Where it couldn't wait
Yeah love remembers

You might convince yourself
There's shelter in a bottle
For a while there it might numb the pain
But when it hits you, then it hits you
That love's still gone and you'll be wishin'
That you'd poured it down the drain
'Cause love remembers

The taste of cotton candy lip gloss
On the lips of a long kiss
And the plans they made together
Yeah love remembers
To feel the fingertips
Running through soakin' wet hair
On the bank after a midnight swim
Yeah love remembers

Yeah love remembers

Care for another Martini?
I could wet my whistle
Brandy, sir?

Bartender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 AM
The door was locked, so I kicked it in

She was trippin' on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard

And in my drunken stupor
I did what I should've never done
Now I'm sittin' here, talkin' to you
Drunk and on the run

I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car

And crashed that piece o' shit
And then stepped away

Ya know Mo I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers till they get here
Yeah, I know the sun is comin' up
And y'all are probably gettin' ready for closin' up

But I'm tryin' to drown my soul
I'm tired of this life on the dirt road
And everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hangin' on

She got me sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car

And crashed that piece o' shit
And then stepped away

Guess it was meant to be, romance is misery so much for memories
And now I am headed to the penitentiary, see me on TV
The next cop series, I am a danger
I guess I should'a did something about my anger

But I never learn real things I don't concern
I pour kerosene on everything I love and watch it burn
I know it's my fault, but I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit, so I crashed that piece of shit Nova

And now I'm goin' back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
When we all pile out that county van
They'll ask me where I been

I've been at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car

Just a kid, chasing my dreams

And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother

And amazing grace is what we'd sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call

84,85,Taylor Swift,"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I haven't seen you around, before

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be, fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car, and you're feelin' like flyin'
And your Mama's waitin' up, and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends, when the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss, makes your head spin round
But, in your life you'll do things greater than, datin' the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted, was to be wanted
Wish you could go back, and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind 
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything, and just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be, at fifteen

She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in her shoe
Something borrowed, something blue

And when the church doors opened up wide 
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears 
Oh she just couldn't believe it 
She heard the trumpets from the military band 
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now, 
This can't be happening to me 
This is just a dream

The preacher man said ""let's bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt""
Then the congregation all stood up and sang 
The saddest song, that she ever heard 
And then they handed her a folded up flag

And she held on to all she had left of him 
Oh and what could've been 
And then the guns rang one last shot 
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background

How we don't have a song""

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window

The first date ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home

Could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong had been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said:

Our song is the slammin' screen doors
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow

And when I got home

Waited for something to come along

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed ford
My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower son
Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine

On our family tree

In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.

There's a melancholy in his eyes, for all of you who care enough to wonder why
Let me tell you
It all started back in 1957 when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
That's the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years too soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April 4th, Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now there's more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why, might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December 1980, no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year, to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why, he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes
Then he told me
I've seen so much in my life I've never questioned, this time the good Lord took me by surprise

And as I unrolled them, the first thing I noticed
Was there were no doors in the plans
He said if you build this for me
Then when she comes back
She'll never be able to leave me again

I said if I did
And she ever came back
Friend, tell me how would she get in
It would just be a prison that I locked you in
If you couldn't leave
You'd never know if there was someone to love you
The way that she didn't before
There's two things that I know for sure
It's that you can't make a women feel something she don't
And you can't build a house with no doors

O'while he was quiet, I could tell he was thinking
I thought I just ruined his day
I just couldn't bear to see this man's last hope slip away
So I thought real fast, and I started talking
Said Buddy we tried this before,
And if there ain't one, she'll make one
Either way she'll run
And leave you a house with a hole for a door

I said if I did
And she ever came back
Friend, tell me how would she get in
It would just be a prison that I locked you in
If you couldn't leave
You'd never know if there was someone to love you

And sit there in my pickup truck and pray
And staring at that giant cross

Lookin' just to score another deal
With my back against that damn eight ball

It held extra line, lures, hooks, and matches.
And his last name engraved in black,
Right there by the handle on the top.
I'd slide it out of the back of his station wagon.
Lug it down the bank with my arm draggin'.
And I could hardly wait for him
To lift the lid on that tackle box.

'Cause I'd sail with him across the South Pacific.
Stand beside him on the bow of that battleship.
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus.
And watch him run to Grandma, cryin' on the dock.
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box.

He'd bait my hook and keep on tellin' stories
'Bout nickel Cokes, girls, and sandlot glories.
Pickup trucks and golden fields
Long before this town knew blacktop.

Takin' turns on a jug of homemade shine
As he raced his buddies down through Mason Holler
Fillin' the sky with dust and kicked up rocks

And I'm still holdin' on to one wish

For one more afternoon and one more fish.

But you got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire

We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exsist
And for that forsake it all

They're so hell-bent on giving
Walking a wire
Convinced it's not living
If you stand outside the fire

Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

There's this love that is burning
Deep in my soul constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to glide higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire
