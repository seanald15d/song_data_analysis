1,2,Sheryl Crow,"I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And he's taken just all that I had
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know the first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky he's cursed
And when it comes to loving me he's worst

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
If you want, I'll try to love again, try

2,3,Mark Wills,"I saw Star Wars at least 8 times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside,
Stretch Armstrong
Yeah

I was Roger Staubach back in my back yard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evil Kinevil scars
On my right arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried

It was 1970-something
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Faucett hair-do days
Bell bottoms and 8-track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1970-something

It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
Dad broke down and finally shaved
Them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubix cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A Space Shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and Black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Aww, It was 1980-something

Now I got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish sometimes
Sometimes...

3,4,Darryl Worley,"I hear people saying we don't need this war
I say there's some things worth fighting for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground
We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in
Before you start your preaching let me ask you this my friend

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away


Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I've been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten how it felt that day?
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell?
We had neighbors still inside going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten all the people killed?
Some went down like heroes in that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten about our Pentagon?
All the loved ones that we lost and those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry about bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

4,5,Kenny Chesney,"All he could think about was, I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead, hell I'm just a kid myself
How'm I gonna raise one

All he could see were his dreams, goin' up in smoke
So much for ditchin' this town, and hangin' out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone, and he said

There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all goodbye
There goes my life

A couple years of up all night and a, few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made, covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah, he loves that little girl

Mamas waitin' to tuck her in, as she fumbles up those stairs

Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncin' curls, and he smiles 

There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, daddy good night
There goes my life

She has that Honda loaded down, with Abercrombie clothes
And fifteen pairs of shoes, and his American Express

Somebody blew up a building

Somebody got away
Somebody didn't get too far yeah
They didn't get too far

Grandpappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree, round up all of them bad boys
Hang them hign in the street for all the people to see that

Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line
When the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
We'll all meet back at the local saloon
We'll raise up our glasses against evil forces
Singing whiskey for my men, beer for my horses

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We've got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets
It's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground

6,7,Blake Shelton,"My brother said that I was rotten to the core.
I was the youngest child so I got by with more.
I guess she was tired by the time I came along.
She'd laugh until she cried I could do no wrong.
She would always save me because I was her baby.

I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the Bayou,
I drove a truck in Birmingham. I Turned 21 in Cincinnati,
I called home to mom and daddy, I said Your boy is now a man.
She said I don't care if you're 80, you'll always be my baby.

She loved that photograph of our whole family.
She'd always point us out for all her friends to see.
That's Greg he's doing great, he really loves his job.
Ronnie with his 2 kids, how 'bout that wife he's got.
And that one's kinda crazy, but that one is my baby.

I got a call in Alabama, said come on home to Louisiana 
And come as fast as you can fly.
'Cause your momma really needs you, and says she's got to see you, 
She might not make it through the night.
The whole way I drove 80, so she could see her baby.

She looked like she was sleepin' and my family had been weepin' 
By the time that I got to her side.
And I knew that she'd been taken and my heart it was breakin', 
I never got to say goodbye.

7,8,Dierks Bentley,"Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinkin'?

She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...
'Cause I was...

Thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top sittin' right
There in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss man just gotta get
Goin' where a night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
But what was I thinkin'... what was I thinkin'

By the county line the cops were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinkin'?

Out the other side she was hollerin' faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'?

Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late...

Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth

I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinkin', oh what was I thinkin'

Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... 'cause I was

11,12,Brooks & Dunn,"I was raised off of rural route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walk to church on Sunday morning
And race barefoot back to Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned the corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road.

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

Her daddy didn't like me much
In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
And drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers (I heard)
I've come to know there's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road.

I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight

And time stood still, and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried, remember when

Remember when we vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt, remember when

Remember when old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each others hearts, remember when

Remember when, the sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up, remember when

Remember when thirty seemed so old
Now, lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again, remember when

Remember when we said, when we turn gray
When the children grow up and move away

He was waitin' for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth at a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, ""Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me? I'm feelin' a little low...""
She said, ""I'm off in an hour, and I know where we can go...""

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said, ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I've got no one to send a letter to...
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him, they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

So the letters came from an army camp
In California, then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of 
He said, ""When it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile...
Don't worry, but I won't be able to write for a while...""

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him, they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said, ""Folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead...""
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read that nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young for him, they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming

22,23,Kenny Chesney,"She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that
She'd be discovered someday.

So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them
As she brought them to their feet.

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spot light
She was a big star.

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place.

She signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers.

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spot light
She was a big star.

She doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they are
And where she is now.

Her old neighbors swear they're certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where your going
Less you got somethin' they ain't got.

So she sings tonight
To 20,000 plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us.

She's a big star
As she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard
To get where you are
It feels good in the hot spot light
She's a big star.

23,24,Randy Travis,"A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searchin' for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres
The faith an' love for growin' things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
Did her best to give 'em all a better start
An' that preacher whispered, ""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained bible up
For all of us to see
He said, ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' that preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me""

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know

Write me a list
So we can figure out what we both deserve""

That their love had come to this

Asked the waitress for a pen
And one by one she wrote down
What she wanted most from him

And more for the two of us
Kisses each morning, I love you's at night

She reached across the table and placed it in his hand
And said ""you know this isn't easy for me""
As he thought about the new car, the house and the land
And wondered what that bottom line would be
And a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find

Nobody knows what she's holding back
Wearing the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with the linen and lace

Oh oh

The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearing the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place
Where she's loved
Concrete Angel

Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbors hear but they turn out the light
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When morning comes it will be too late

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place
Where she's loved
Concrete Angel

A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world had forgot

Through the wind and the rain

In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place

Grandma begged me to, But I was afraid of God.
And I wish I'd have listened when they said boy
You're gonna wish you hadn't, But I wouldn't

Can we put a man on the moon
And still have a need
For a place like St. Judes
And why is one man born
In a place where all they know is war
A guy like me,
Has always been free

And how can two people
Who built a loving home
Try for years
And never have a child of their own
And somewhere out there tonight
There is a baby no one's holding tight
In need of love
To me that don't add up

But I wasn't there the day you filled up the ocean
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

And why did my cousin
Have to die in that crash
A good kid
Only seventeen
I still wonder 'bout that
It seems unfair to me
Some get the chance to chase their dreams
And some don't
What do I know

I wasn't there the day You filled up the ocean
I didn't get to see You hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess You
Or criticize what I don't understand

You hear these prayers of mine
When so many outta be

Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues

'Cause I got a first-class ticket
And I'm blue as a boy can be

Walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
Down on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
And watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
There's a pretty little thing
Waitin' on ""The King""
Down in the Jungle Room

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
You got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays the piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
""Tell me are you a Christian""
And I said ""Ma'am I am tonight""

Going somewhere where she'd be wanted
A town this small, all they do is talk
No wedding ring, chipped fingernail polish
She always wished that she could go to college
But some dreams fade, they just slip away

She started to show
A few months ago and she had to go
That's how she wound up

On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Head on down with the windows up
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace
But she fell in love, she fell in love
On the backseat of a Greyhound bus

Oh yeah, yeah

The moon was full, stars were smiling
God has a funny sense of timing
The baby came on the interstate
Somewhere between Jackson and Memphis
She finally found what she had been missing
She cried and laughed while the red lights flashed

Sweet baby girl
She looked into the face of a new
The face of a brand new world

On the backseat of a Greyhound bus
Heart so full that it could bust
Staring at the rest of her life
She never thought this would be the place
Where she would find her saving grace 
But she fell in love, she fell in love

Said look at my toes Dad what's wrong with my skin
Will this go away, will I be normal again

Well he picked me up and set me down on the hamper
Wiped off his face while he gave me the answer
It was the first time I noticed lines in his grin
As he dabbed a little foam on the end of my chin, he said

Those wrinkles ain't nothin' to be scared of
They're just a product of time and true love
Some are gonna come and go
Some are gonna come and stay
Son, you're still young, you're gonna be ok

Well I walked down the hall, saw my Momma gettin' ready
For a long over due date, dinner with Daddy
She was cussin' those crows feet, didn't know I was listenin'
Started talkin' 'bout her younger years

Throw the covers off my head
Shake my body out of bed
Stretch my arms up
And look out the window
Sun is rising
Birds are singing
I am greeted by the gift of another new morning
And I know tonight as my head hits the pillow
I will ask myself as I look out the same window
At the end of the day
Did I laugh and dance enough
Did I tell my friends how much they really mean to me
At the end of the day
Did I really push myself
Or was I too afraid
To give my heart away
At the end of the day
I wanna learn I wanna live
Take some big chance and just trust in my instincts and my intuition
If I win or if I lose
Any road that I choose
I will drive all the way


I wanna know tonight as I fall fast asleep
I am one day closer
To where I wanna be
At the end of the day
Did I laugh and dance enough
Did I tell my friends how much they really mean to me

As she blew out the candles, on her last birthday cake
She wants to ride a pony, when she's big enough

And I tried to have fun
With her on my mind
But even the laughter
It wasn't much of a break

With a couple of friends and said
Hey man have you seen her at all?
Like, where's she been?

This broken hearted pain
I wouldn't have to
Carry you around with me
And it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
And are you coming back again
I swear I can't take you anywhere

So I left all alone
I just headed on home
As I listened to the messages on my telephone
There was one from my sister
And one of an old friend
(Hey man, I drove by your house tonight, dude, but uh)
You wasn't in
Just checkin' up on you boy

About best friends.

John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me.

The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

Well now, I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.
(And he'd say.)

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said, don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.

Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas.

Learned to drink Sangria
'Til the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo.

At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came runnin' down the hall
Wearin nothin'
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero.

Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said

On Mexican soil
See the boarder guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash.

In Mexico, Amigo.

Was savin' my own tail

In an over-sized pack
Letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers

Dangerously close to one another

John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me.

The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

Well now, I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said, don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.

Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas.

Learned to drink Sangria
'Til the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo.

Ah, but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came runnin' down the hall
Wearin nothin'
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero.

We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the boarder guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash.

In Mexico, Amigo.

Was savin' my own tail

In a Mexican jail

Who lights you up like the rising sun
But he's been hurt and he won't feel
Like handin' you a heart of steel
Well don't you run now just you stay
You're the one that can melt away
The loneliness down in his heart
Just take him in your arms.

We were just about as wild as we were green,
In the ways of the world.
Well she picked me up in that red rag top,
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops,
On a summer night, running all the red lights.

We parked way out in a clearing in a grove,
And the night was as hot as a coal burning stove.
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green eyed girl had been a mother to be, for two weeks.
I was out of a job and she was in school,
And life was fast and the world was cruel,
We were young and wild, we decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down, there would be no regrets in the morning light,
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun,
But it was all make believe in the end,
No I can't say where she is today,
I can't remember who I was back then.

And there's no such thing as what might have been
That's a waste of time, drive you outta your mind.

Will cast you adrift

Cruising through the cosmos
