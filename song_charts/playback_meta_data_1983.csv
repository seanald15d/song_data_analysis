0,1,Kenny Rogers with Dolly Parton,"Baby when I met you, there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine toothed comb
I was soft inside
There was somethin' going on

You do somethin' to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on

Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
Honest love, we feel, needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Making love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me

No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

1,2,Sheena Easton,"I saw an old friend of ours today
She asked about you, I didn't quite know what to say
Heard you've been making the rounds 'round here
While I've been trying to make tears disappear

Now I'm almost over you
I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around 
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

You're such a sly one with your cold, cold heart
Maybe leaving came easy, but it tore me apart

'Cause it seems like forever, but I'm letting you go

Now I'm almost over you

So when you come back around

5,6,Alabama,"It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen
A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams
The ties that once bound her now are broke away
And she's like a baby, just learning how to play.

She never thought that love could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon
When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday.

Now, she's a lady down on love
She needs somebody to gently pick her up
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down.

Well, I know a lady that's down on her love
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch
But work took me a way from home late at nights
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust.

And counts a new line that seemed to appear overnight

And a thousand strands of gray wont disguise

Staring at the flashing sign
It read: come on in and watch young
Scarlet's body come alive
Let her dance for you and cast her spell
You'll swear you can believe her
Be careful not to catch the scarlet fever.

So I paid my fare and walked down front
And found an empty chair
As I settled in young scarlet took the ribbons from her hair
The moves her body made while the music played
Were the likes I've never seen
And she became the envy of my dreams.

One by one her teasing movements
Brought the crowd out of their seats
And all at once young scarlet
Danced straight up in front of me
From the moment that her eyes found mine
I've never been the same
Scarlet locked another heart upon her chain.

Now I get scarlet fever every time I see her
But she's a night club teaser
Not paid to notice me
Yes, I get scarlet fever
If she knew how much I need her
She'd place her hand in my hand
And dance away with me.

She looked 25 but I was told
That she was just 16
She had a way of making a man believe
She danced for only him
As she tantalized I fantasized
And felt the sound of my heart beat
And every night I'd dream
She'd fall in love with me.

Then one night while driving in
My eyes begun to tear
'Cause the sign outside the Lucky Star
Said: scarlet isn't here
She'd left that day to find a life
Of bigger and better things
And she left behind my chain of broken dreams.

But still get scarlet fever
In my mind I still see her
Out there dancing somewhere
To another fool like me.

Staring at the flashing sign
It read: come on in and watch young
Scarlet's body come alive
Let her dance for you and cast her spell
You'll swear you can believe her
Be careful not to catch the scarlet fever.

So I paid my fare and walked down front
And found an empty chair
As I settled in young scarlet took the ribbons from her hair
The moves her body made while the music played
Were the likes I've never seen
And she became the envy of my dreams.

One by one her teasing movements
Brought the crowd out of their seats
And all at once young scarlet
Danced straight up in front of me
From the moment that her eyes found mine
I've never been the same
Scarlet locked another heart upon her chain.

Now I get scarlet fever every time I see her
But she's a night club teaser
Not paid to notice me
Yes, I get scarlet fever
If she knew how much I need her
She'd place her hand in my hand
And dance away with me.

She looked 25 but I was told
That she was just 16
She had a way of making a man believe
She danced for only him
As she tantalized I fantasized
And felt the sound of my heart beat
And every night I'd dream
She'd fall in love with me.

Then one night while driving in
My eyes begun to tear
'Cause the sign outside the Lucky Star
Said: scarlet isn't here
She'd left that day to find a life
Of bigger and better things
And she left behind my chain of broken dreams.

But still get scarlet fever
In my mind I still see her
Out there dancing somewhere
To another fool like me.

Halfway around the world on a train
New York to Orleans, Japan to Tibet
But the farther I go, the closer you get
And I can't get you out of my mind
All these years to forget, all these miles in jet
But the farther I go, the closer you get.

I took some dreams, I can't damp some dust
I damned your name, I cried and I cursed
I run to the ends of the earth to forget
But the farther I go, the closer you get.

I found a friend, I took her home
I took her upstairs, disconnected the phone
We got warmer and warmer
Been blazing hot
But the farther we went, the closer you got

We buried the plans that we made 
And tonight I'm alone and afraid
