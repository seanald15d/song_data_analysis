1,2,Keith Whitley,"It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all

All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Old Mr. Webster could never define
What's being said between your heart and mine

The smile on your face lets me know that you need me

2,3,Restless Heart,"Some people are born to live alone
And go about life that way,
Their home is a long stretch
Of blacktop and everyday,

They like movin' and stayin on the run

Rollin' down the highway what a fine time
That's the only way to feel

Stay under me,
Stay under me

Stay under me,
Stay under me

It's a freedom that we all wanna know
It's an obsession to some
To keep the world in your rearview mirror

Get to where you're goin'
You're never there against your will

Almost time to clock in
The boys are all betting that Joe wouldn't show
They'd seen him over the weekend
He had four new tires on that Cadillac
Betty the waitress had some clothes in the back
Dashboard full of road maps of Mexico, Joe knows how to live

He said women were made to love, money is made to spend
Life is something, baby, you will never win again
Oh, I've got to admit it, Joe sure knows how to live

By now they'll be down at the ocean
He and Betty stretched out somewhere
The only blue in his life is the blue moonlight

Bouncing off Betty's blonde hair

Oh I can just see 'em rolling around in the sand
I never thought I was a jealous man
But when I think what he's doing and what I'm not, oh, I'm jealous a lot

Now Betty's back home with her mother
Joe's back on the assembly line
But he brings his pictures and his Mexican hat
Just to remind us sometimes

Oh, I hate to admit it, Joe sure knows how to live

Taking time enough for mending

This is such a surprise to see you
Girl, you're looking so good; it's been a long time
Since you've crossed my mind

I came looking around for something to do

Just a change of my plans on leaving
And I stay around and I run into you

I've lived alone for awhile

Just looking for something that's already happened
Years go by but you and I don't have to look beyond today

Maybe just for tonight
We can turn out the light

Lay your heart on the line
Let go of your mind

You know just what to say
You know just what to do

With a shiner on my eye
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why

And waited for the worst

Had been tested to the end

37 years cut across his back,
He gave it all he had for what he believed.

And I still believe, I still believe.

And the rain on the roof when I close my eyes;
I can still hear us laughing on the front porch in the dark.

You're gonna have to learn to let go
