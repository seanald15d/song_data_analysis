0,1,Alabama,"I'll admit I could feel it 
The first time that we touched
The look in your eyes
Said you felt as much
But I'm not a man
Who falls so easily 
It's best that you know
Where you stand with me

I will give you my heart
Faithful and true
And all the love it can hold
That's all I can do 
But I've thought about 
How long I'll love you
And it's only fair that you know
Forever's as far as I'll go

When there's age around my eyes
And gray in your hair
And it only takes a touch to recall
The love we've shared
I won't take for granted
That you know my love is true
Each night in your arms
I will whisper to you

I will give you my heart
Faithful and true
And all the love it can hold

1,2,Garth Brooks,"Just the other night
At a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into
My old highschool flame
And as I introduced them
The past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of
The way things used to be

She was the one
That I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin'
That God would make her mine
And if He'd only granted me
This wish I'd wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God
For unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin'
To the man upstairs
That just because He doesn't answer
Doesn't mean He don't care!
Some of God's greatest gifts are
Unanswered prayers...!

She wasn't quite the angel
That I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me,
And her eyes too, it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows
What He's doing after all

And as she walked away
Well I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God
For unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin'
To the man upstairs
And just because He may not answer
Doesn't mean He don't care!
Some of Gods greatest gifts
Are unanswered...
Some of Gods greatest gifts
Are all too often unanswered...

4,5,George Strait,"I got sent home from school one day
With a shiner on my eye
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When Dad got home, I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those tremblin' knees
And waited for the worst

And he said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
He said, ""Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen""
It's a love without end, amen

When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy
Was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience
Had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him

I said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us""
I said, ""Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen""
It's a love without end, amen

Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done
They'll never let me in
Then somewhere from the other side I heard those words again

They said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us
You see, daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen""

The dance we shared, beneath the stars above

And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives, are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain, but I'da had to miss, the dance

Holding you, I held everything
For a moment, wasn't I a king

Nervous wreck
I can't believe she said goodbye

A million lines and I bought 'em every one

Find my cowboy boots, my button down, strap my timepiece on my arm
Grab my billfold, my pocket change, just a mindless old routine
Then it's out the door and down the street, but it's not really me

I still comb my hair the same, still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pickup truck that the same old bank still owns
But since you left, everybody says, I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on, but nobody's home

Cup of coffee in the mornin', it's just food for the brain 
But I've been numb since our last goodbyes, I haven't felt a thing
But now there's pains in my head and pains in my chest, and I think I'm losing my hair

In a while the heartache faded
And I found somebody new

I had it all figured out
I wouldn't make the same mistakes

71,72,Restless Heart,"Dancy was a deacon
Every Sunday found him there
At the Lighthouse Gospel Church
With his hands folded in prayer
And standin' right beside him
Was his pretty hometown bride
But no one could have guessed
What he was prayin' deep inside

Dancy has a demon
Livin' Somewhere in his past
That dark-haired Cajun angel
Was the devil dressed in black
Was it really voodoo
Or just weakness in the man
The only time he ever fell
Was when she took his hand

Oh It's been so long, but it's still so strong
Every night the devil comes and walks through Dancy's dream
She takes him by the hand and leads him back to New Orleans
A good man's goin' crazy somewhere in between
The hymns on Sunday mornin' and the sins in Dancy's dream

Sometimes it's almost like
He was never even there
But other times he swears he smells
The flowers in her hair
He never told his secret
No one would understand
She's the only one who's seen
The dark side of the man

To measure every inch
The work it got harder
When he cut across the grain
But he just put more shoulder to the plane

As he carved out every line
He made a thing of beauty
From a rough 'ol piece of pine
He seem to have the vision
Of what the end would be

The lawman and the cowboy pushed their horses on
Racin' toward the Rio running out of time
They had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline.

Well, the lawman wanted justice the cowboy revenge
They tracked the Outlaws' horses up to the river's edge
And there across the Rio a badge ain't worth a dime
The law was in their own hands once they crossed the borderline.

So they ride to the desert wind down a dusty trail, destiny begins
Heroes never turn or look back
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline

In the safety of the badlands the outlaws stopped their run
The campfire rings with laughter of evil things they've done
How they'd taken all they wanted and killed the cowboy's wife
And knew no one would follow them, cross the borderline.

The lawman and the cowboys stepped out of the dark
And it was two against the twenty and every bullet found its mark
And so goes the legend that out there in the night
The two still ride together somewhere beyond the borderline.

So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins

Every morning of our lives
The classroom rang with children's voices
Under teacher's watchful eye

We learned about the world around us
At our desks and at dinnertime
Reminded of the starving children
We cleaned our plates with guilty minds

And the stones in the road
Shone like diamonds in the dust
And then a voice called to us
To make our way back home

When I was ten, my father held me
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning
Pass slowly through our town

His widow kneeled with all their children
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer
With all the cities burning down

And the stones in the road
They flew out beneath our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires
As we raced each other home

And now we drink our coffee on the run
We climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons
And here's the line that's missing

The starving children have been replaced
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass
And hope our eyes don't meet

We pencil in, we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass, we make you hold
We doctor the receipt

And the stones in the road
They fly out from beneath our wheels
Another day, another deal
Before we get back home

Leave a mark whence they came

And it's not every night a comet comes around

To dream a little dream of a comet's charms

368,N/A,Mary Chapin Carpenter,"I can recall the sound of the wind
As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
I can recall the smell of the rain
On a hot summer night
Coming through the screen

I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast
Its light all around your room

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs
Staring up at the blue and the blue stared back

I used to believe we were just like those trees
We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased
With our feet on the ground and our arms in the breeze
Under a sheltering sky

Twirl me about, and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down,
Say it was only a dream

A big truck was parked in the drive one day
They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine
And this kid sister thing was old by that time

But oh how our dreams went bump in the night
And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Twirl me about and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it was only a dream

The day you left home you got an early start
I watched your car back out in the dark
I opened the door to your room down the hall
I turned on the light
And all that I saw
Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks
No sign of someone who expects to be back
It must have been one hell of a suitcase you packed

Twirl me about, twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground

You've been talking like you're of a mind to get some changing done
Maybe move out of the city, find some quiet little town

And watch the sun go down
Well, no one knows where they belong
The search just goes on and on and on
For every choice that ends up wrong
Another one's right
A change of scene would sure be great
The thought is nice to contemplate
But the question begs why would you wait
And be late for your life

Now you might never find that perfect town
But the sun still sets on a rooftop where the city
Sounds like a Gershwin clarinet
And you might still be searching every face for one you can't forget
Well, love is out there in a stranger's clothes
You just haven't met him yet
Well, no one knows where they belong

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below

They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around
And around and around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain and I'll be back again
And again and again and again and again",Spirit,There You Are / Spirit,1989,2,3:04,Track 'B',Single,False
