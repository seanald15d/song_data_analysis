No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain't got no cigarettes

And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around

1,2,The Statler Brothers,"I keep hearing you're concerned about my happiness
But all that thought you're giving me is conscience, I guess
If I were walking in your shoes I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worrying about me, I'm having lots of fun

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine
You can always find me here and having quite a time

Counting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playing solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one
Smoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me I've nothing to do

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Warmer lips to kiss her,
Arms to hold her tighter,
Stirring new fires inside her,

Spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket

""May an elephant caress you with his toes""
""May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose""

Where I'd sit me down to rest
Like a snowbird on his nest
And read the Sears and Roebuck catalog

I would hum a happy tune
Peeping through the quarter moon
As my daddy's kin had done before

It gave the same relief

And build my castles to

I could orbit around the sun
Fight with General Washington
Or be a King upon a golden throne

It had newspapers on the wall
It was air conditioned
In the wintertime

It was just a humble hut
But it's door was never shut
And a man could get inside

Like my heart's sprung a big break
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now, you might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call

How I lived in fear of wakin' up each morning

I can still hear her cry I love you and I'll prove it Manana
Then seeing my danger she jumped in front of his knife
I know the stories they'll tell in dimly casinos
Of the raven haired beauty who for her love laid dead on the floor

She said, son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye

I got to know the kind of girls it's better not to know
I fell in with a bad crowd and laughed and drank with them

She said, son, be a proud man and hold your head up high
Walk tall, walk straight and look the world right in the eye

I got in trouble with the law and I'm in prison now
Through these prison bars I see things so much different now
I've got one year left to serve and when my time is done
I'll walk tall and straight and make ma proud to call me son

169,N/A,Marty Robbins,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved

So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina, goodbye",El Paso,Marty Robbins Gold,1975,20,,Track 'A1',Single,False

In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins that the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses and you'll never see a-one
But sometimes between the setting and the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marching by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky.

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for.

Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo.""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free.

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo.

""You may ne'er see your loved ones,""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay.""

In the sand he drew a line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancing
On a horse that was black as the night.

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousing rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play deguello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Every one will be put to the sword!""

One hundred and eighty five
Holding back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were coming
Never came, never came, never came...

Twice he charged and blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed 'em, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers...

Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...

In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazing where a century before

And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly...

One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.

The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.

A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.

He used to play it right here
I forget the year around '45, I think
Ha, I could tell you quite a story friend
If you'd care to buy me a drink.

Well, I possessed by every weakness
That takes a man a fool
I bought a round, he drank it down
And then he rocked back on his stool.

He said, Yeah, I remember now
It was '45 alright.
He just returned from the Great War
That's where he lost his sight.

His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain 
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.

He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
To come appear on the Grand Ole Opry
The greatest show at all.

I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.

I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.

But he died that night, life just demanded
More than he could give
I think he couldn've made it
He just lost his will to live.

Not many people know
So I'll tell you the story
Of a hobo and the rose

In our town a young man
Loved this lady fair
He gave to her a white rose
To wear in her hair
But she in turn gave to him
A rose that he would wear
To prove that their love was true
And that they'd always care

But her father was a rich man
The town respected him
Since the young man was a poor man's son
Their chance for love grew dim
Her father forced upon her
Another man to wed
And this put the young man
On the tracks so the people said

He became a hobo
In dirty ragged clothes
But upon the dirty clothes he wore
He wore this one white rose
He traveled far to many towns
In his life upon the tracks
But he never found another love
So he decided to come back

His sweetheart was still married
Her children numbered five
And trying to make her house a home
She forgot he was alive
Then one day she saw a crowd
Thank you for using Lyricsvault.net

Gathered by the railroad track
By the sign of the one white rose
She knew that he'd come back

There she saw a beaten man
In dirty ragged clothes
She only recognized him
By the one crushed white rose
They buried him in a poor man's grave
Out on Proper's Hill
With no one to mourn him
But the lonely whippoorwill

If you should pass his grave
On a warm summer's night
You'll see upon his grave
A rose so clear and white
 
This is my story always I suppose

Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall.
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin.
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall.

Play the dead march as you carry me along.
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me,

Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother,
An' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone.
But please not one word of the man who had killed me.
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on.

I just told her I was goin' out and loudly slammed the door
I slipped back in to hide myself my jealous heart was hurtin'
From all the things I thought I'd hear while hid behind the curtain
Hiding behind the curtain
I know that I will catch them now that they think I'm gone
Hiding behind the curtain
It's hard to stand still when you're where you don't belong

Well not a thing has happened and I've stood here half the night
I've had lots of time to wonder if I'm wrong or right
But jealousy has eaten up this busting heart and soul
And sentenced me to hide behind the courtain till I know
At last there goes the telephone he must be on his way
But then I felt as small as nothing when I heard her say
Please stop spreading rumors I don't love you that's for certain
Then I knew she still loved this fool hiding behind the curtain

And now I'm tired of roaming this life is not much fun
I'd like to go home if I had one
I've known all kinds of women the rowdy and the nice
I've even thought of marriage but I've never thought of that twice
And now I feel the loneliness with every setting sun
I'd love to see my baby if I had one
I've made a lot of money I've also spent a lot

It was three in the morning she was all alone but don't you mention that to the boss
As far as he's concerned I made a little wrong turn
And from there on out I guess I got lost

I could stop and sleep but my freight won't keep I got a deadline for makin' a call
I couldn't stay in bed I got an oversize head and my hat's about a size too small
I got my jaker break off and my windshield smeared
I'm headin' south drivin' into the wind
The only thing that keeps me hangin' on to this job
Is thinkin' I'm a gonna get lost again
I got lost or I could've made it right on time...

Well my stick she's quiet and my rig rolls easy like it has for many years
Make it on long night on the little white lines I gotta go on a hummin' in my ears
If the fux don't get me with that radar bit I'll besteady creepin' up on the block

I got home Monday morning tore up like a can of Kraut
My only suit was layin' on the steps
I just picked up and run and I ain't been back there since
Well mad yeah she's mad
It's back to the doghouse I know from the practise I've had
When she's mad I play a dangerous game
In the obituary column they've already printed my name

She's five feet three and weights about hundred and eight
She's the kind of gal who don't believe in men a makin' mistakes
She's sweet and mighty nice
But when she's mad she's got a voice that'll cut through ice
Well mad ooh she's mad...

She's got eyes like a cat and she watches every move that I make

(Changed his name from Brown to blue.)

We stood there in the courthouse room 
So close yet far apart,
You had brought your lawyer 
And I'd brought a broken heart,
The judge pronounced the words 
The way you wanted him to do,
And changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue.

I couldn't keep my tears from falling,
On the courtroom floor,
By law, they took away my rights,
To love you anymore,
My world just seemed to stop,
While I stood there so close to you,
They changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue.

The judge forgot to tell me 
How I'd live my life alone,
What I would do without you 
After loving you so long,
He didn't seem to care that 
I am still in love with you,
He changed your name from Brown to Jones,
And mine from Brown to blue.
