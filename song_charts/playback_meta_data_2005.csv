0,1,Bon Jovi & Jennifer Nettles,"I spent twenty years tryin' to get out of this place 
I was looking for something I couldn't replace 
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known

And like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back 
The seeds I've sown, saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own 
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 

I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I left a million miles of memories on that road 
And every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known,
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place that call me one of their own 
Just a hometown boy, born a rollin' stone
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?

I've been there, done that, I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road, feels like I've never left
That's how the story goes

It doesn't matter where you are, doesn't matter where you go 
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road 
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?

Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact 
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feelin' kinda wild tonight

And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face... I said girls...

I ain't as good as I once was

When I could really lay it down

Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots, got in a tight spot
Hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big fat biker man
I heard David yell across the room
Hey buddy, how 'bout a helpin' hand... I said Dave...

I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really hold my own

Guess them boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was, but I'm as good once
As I ever was

I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says you can't do this boy
But my pride says oh yes you can...

I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feelin' bullet proof
So don't double-dog dare me now

2,3,Carrie Underwood,"She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on""

And my poor mother sat between 'em both all night

We're all aware that he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he loved to be a soldier more than most

And how my life is like a roller coaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way

18,19,Montgomery Gentry,"There's a story that my daddy tells religiously,
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening,
In a conversation, 'bout the way things use to be.

I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door,
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor,
Hanging onto every word; man, the things I heard

It was harder times and longer days,
Five miles to school uphill both ways,
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor,
Course that was back before the war,
Yeah your uncle and I made quit a pair,
Flying F-15's through hostile air,
He went down but they missed me by a hair,
He'd always stop right there and say,

That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
As your chins held high as the tears fall down,
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out,
Like a small town flag a flying,
Or a new born baby crying,
In the arms of the woman that you love,
That's something to be proud of,

Son graduating college, that was momma's dream,
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen,
That's when you got a fast car, and think you got everything

I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith,
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A.
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage

I fell in love next thing I know,
Babies came and the car got sold,
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod,
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs,
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down,
If you're ashamed how I turned out,
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow,
Said let me tell you right now

That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
No need to make a million just be thankful to be working,
If you're doing what you're able,
Putting food there on the table,
And providing for the family that you love,
That's something to be proud of

And if all you ever really do is the best you can...
Well, you did it man

That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
As your chins held high as the tears fall down,
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out,

Or a new born baby crying,
In the arms of the woman that you love,

To Vegas once, then to Honolulu.
Let herself go to New York City:
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty.
When he said he didn't love her no more,
She let herself go.

She poured her heart an' soul into their three-bedroom ranch.
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironin' his pants.
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note,
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go.

Let herself go on her first blind-date:
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake.
Let herself go, buy a brand new car,
Drove down to the beach he always said was too far.

Got a date a week from Friday with a preacher's son
Everybody says he's crazy
I'll have to see

I finally moved to Jackson when the summer came
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
I'm probably going on and on
It seems I'm doing more of that these days

I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky to have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
'Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way

Mama says that I just shouldn't speak to you
Susan says that I should just move on
You oughta see the way these people look at me
When they see me round here talking to this stone
Everybody thinks I've lost my mind
But I just take it day by day

I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes I feel an angel's touch

She's never rocked Central Park to a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game
She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon ride around the world
No she's just your everyday average girl (but)

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs
The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

She didn't get a check every week like a nine-to-fiver
But she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition
But now her baby's movin' on and she'll soon be missin' her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest
It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughter's starin' at all the photographs
Of her mother
And she wishes she could be like that
Oh but she already is

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home
She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know

I said you'll see what I mean
If you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try

About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there
Right next to the stage

Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
""How ya keep from goin' crazy?""

Do you want fries with that?

Yeah, your ketchup's in the bag
And her check is in the mail.
Now I hope your chicken's raw inside,
And I hope the bun is stale.

I hope you both choke on a pickle!

Over there on the counter?
You don't wanna read that thing, man,

Bad about her: she's gone.

No, no, no, no, don't, don't throw it away,
'Cause tonight, I might need it.
It gets real lonely around here at night some times,
An' I have to read read it.
Besides, you can show it to the boys down town,
They won't believe that she's gone.

There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted.
All the man that she'll ever need.
I come home to find, just like that, she's up an' vanished.
An' the only thing she left behind for me:

Is this big blue note,
Folded up in my pocket.
Yeah, don't laugh: it's been two months;
I still got it.
Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice,
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that she's gone.

You know, my psychiatrist said:
""Tell me, what do you see,
""When you look at these inkspots,
""Of, er, reds, yellows an' greens?""
You know, I looked at 'em all, 
But they all looked to me like big blue notes.

There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted.
All the man that she'll ever need.
I come home to find, just like that, she's up an' vanished.

Overlooking the sea.

No real problems we needed to drown
But we tried our best anyway

We had a keg in the closet, pizza on the floor

Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted

Right there on that Lambda Chi porch

Little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers and
A juke box song ringing in my ears
The next you know the bar tenders pouring, shots are flowing, got me stonin'
All I really know is that I should be going,
But I'm soaking up the moment

I'm all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much.
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies when you're all jacked up

It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock,
What the hell I have one more shot.
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar,
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far.
Cause a big ole girl walked outta the blue,
10 foot 2 with a bad attitude
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth,
Guess I had it coming I deserved the due

'Cause I was all jacked up, all jacked up,
Don't believe I've ever had this much.
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up.

Don't have to go home but you can't stay here,
That's what they said when I got my last beer.


Oh my God, its 2 o'clock, I can't find my keys and my trucks locked
So I grabbed a tire tool and I broke my window,
Hurt my elbow got me in though
Two foot later backed into the light pole,
All the town folk got a good show
All jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much.

Momma put me on a Greyhound an' I went to stay with her in the summertime.

Well, Grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, blue collar of a man.
He came from the school where you didn't need nothin',
If you couldn't make it with your own two hands.
He was backwoods, backwards, used words like:
""No Sir,"" ""Yes, Ma'am,"" ""By God,"" ""Be darned,""
""Hell yeah, I'm American.""
In all the years he walked this earth,
I swear all he did was work.
He said: ""The devil dreams on an idle horse,
""So you listen to me squirt.

""Don't get too high on the bottle,
And get right with the Man.
Fight your fights, find a grace,
And all the things that you can change,
And help somebody if you can.""

Now Granny said: ""Sonny, stick to your ganas,
If you believe in something, no matter what,
'Cause it's better to be hated for who you are,
Than be loved for who you're not.""
She was five feet of concrete
New York born an' raised on a slick city street.
She'd cold-stare you down, stand her ground,
Still kickin' and screamin' at 93.
I remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed:
Takin' her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said:

""Don't get too high on the bottle,
Just a little sip ev'ry now and then.
Fight your fights, find a grace,
And all the things that you can change,
And help somebody if you can.
And get right with the Man.""

(C'mon now.)

""I never let a cowboy make the coffee.""
Yeah, that's what Granny always said to my Grandad.
And he'd say: ""Never tell a joke that ain't that funny more than once.""
And ""if you wanna hear God laugh, tell Him your plans.""

""Don't get too high on the bottle,
Get right with the Man, son.
Fight your fights, find a grace,
And all the things that you can change,
And help somebody if you can.

On a blanket lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain

Cotton fields remember when
Flash 'a lightnin' drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was poundin' more
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in, the storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
All the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing

Can't believe I'm back again

He was dressed as a bag of leaves
It hid the braces on his legs at first

His smile was as bright as the August sun
When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway, it almost
Made me hurt

Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do,
In our neighborhood

I've been searchin', wonderin', thinkin'
Lost and lookin' all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right

And his mother's miracle
I've been readin', writin', prayin', fightin'

Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when

Hey Jude was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him, well it's just
Another gift
And I never got to tell her, that the boy
Showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written

You didn't feel like you were the most
Important thing in my life anymore

So I had to turn around and come back
And tell you what I'm gonna do about it

I'm gonna light the bedroom candles
Take the phone out of the wall

For making you feel that way

And way too little on making love

I thought I'd die an old man back in my hometown

There's a big White House sits on a hill just up the road
The man inside, he cried the day they brought me home
They folded up a flag, and told my Mom and Dad
""We're proud of your son."" 

And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property
I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company
I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done
I can rest in peace, I'm one of the chosen ones, I made it to Arlington

I remember daddy brought me here when I was eight
We searched all day to find out where my granddad lay
And when we finally found that cross
He said ""Son, this is what it costs, to keep us free."" 

Now here I am, a thousand stones away from him
He recognized me on the first day I came in
And it gave me a chill, when he clicked his heels
And saluted me

The right thing to do
I picked up the phone and said ""Baby I'm home
I'll be there in a minute or two.""
I stole some of my neighbor's daisies
Grabbed an old bottle of wine

That I'm in for one helluva time

I'm a little bit lonely
Baby, come hold me tonight

Be my one and only
Baby, come over tonight
I'm a little bit lonely

Yeah, who am I to leave you hangin' high and dry
No baby, not tonight
No, no, no, no

On a barstool she took off her ring.

She said,"" I'm no quitter,
But I finally quit living on dreams.

I'm after whatever the other life brings.""

Who sat there beside me.
He had a strange look on his face.

He looked like a mountain,

His big heart was breaking,
He turned to the woman and said,

I thought how she'd made him look small.

Is the same time that one begins

More bills to pay than a corporation
Hey, when will it end
My mirror says I could use a break
An easy day, some appreciation
Hey how 'bout a friend
When days like these start to fall in on me
I gotta face my reflection and say... hey

Been burned by the fire
Been stuck under water
Strung up on a wire and still the world goes around
Been tossed like a free throw
Knocked out when the wind blows
Pull the curtain on the hurtin'
'Cause I'm not going down
(I'm not going down no no)

Inside of me is the only
Highway that leads to a true freedom
Holding out it's hand
I close my eyes and it's all right
The sun will shine on a new horizon
Just around the bend
Days like these bring out the strength in me
So I can face my reflection and say...

Me and Becky didn't waste no time, went zero to 65 one night
Being young was getting old, we were heading down a dead end road
But we didn't care, we were on a roll. Hanging on for the ride
Those lines that we were crossing, carelessly tossing caution to the wind,
Were wearing thin.

We were living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

She loved me.

I think we thought that it would last, but looking back I had to laugh
What a mess we made of that, now I'm not sure that I would want it back
We learned a little bit about love, what it wasn't and what it was
It was fast and it was fun, the beginning of the end of us

One day that road just ran out, but I still travel down it now and then
And once again...

We're living for the minute, loving every second of it

When they carried dad away.

There beside my mother
In the livingroom, I stood
With my brother and my sister
Knowin' dad was gone for good.

Then I, I hung around
Just long enough to lay him in the ground
Then I caught a plane to do a show
Up north in Detroit town.

Because I'm older now and I ain't got not time to cry
I got no time to look back, I got no time to see
The pieces of my heart
That have been ripped away from me.

And if the feelings start to come in
I've learned to stop them fast
'Cause I don't know if I let 'em go
They might not wanna pass.

And there's just so many people
Tryin' to get me on the phone
And there's bills to pay and songs to play
And a house to make a home.

I guess I'm older now and I ain't got not time to cry
I can still remember before I heard of Merle
So many things have changed
So much here in my world.

I remember sitting on the front porch
When an ambulance drove by
Just listening to those sirens
I would break down and cry.

Now, I'm walkin' and I'm talkin'
Doin' just what I'm supposed to do
Working overtime to make sure
I don't come unglued.

Because I'm older now and I ain't got not time to cry
I sit down on the sofa and I watch the evening news
There's a half-a-dozen tragedies
From which to pick and choose.

The baby that was missing
Was found in a ditch today
And there's bombs flying
And people dying not so far away.

I'll take a beer from the fridgerator
And sit in the yard
With a cold one in my hand
I'm gonna bite down and swallow hard.

Because I'm older now
And I ain't got not time to cry.

Its true

I'm older now
Just ain't got not time to cry.

Had him strung out on the ropes
Well, he cried to Jesus
He said, ""Jesus, I think I'm too lost to save.""

As he stepped into the mouth of Nickajack Cave

Everything was darkness
Wasn't no light at all
Just the cold dank air and the pitch black dirt
And the spiders on the walls
Well, he laid down beneath a ledge
And curled up there to meet his judgement day
The shivering came upon him wave by wave
Well, he could feel the breath of death in Nickajack Cave



Then high above him shone a light
He never would forget
Then he heard a voice say, ""Johnny Cash,
I ain't through with you yet.
Get up, I ain't through with you yet.
I ain't through with you yet, Johnny Cash,
Get up.""

Then he crawled out from beneath that ledge
And felt a gentle breeze
Tears and dirt smeared on his face
As peaceful as could be
Well, he knelt down upon the ground
Raised his eyes up to the light and prayed
He said, ""Lord, I'll be your servant from this day.""

It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""
She said just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy
Don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now, don't let me down, now,
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown""

Well, that was the last time I saw my Mama
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
Wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do
And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down""

It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman,
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ears

She said, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down

A lot of years gone by showin' on my face
Nothing in this life that time hasn't changed
I chased a lot of dreams and some of them came true
Ain't it funny how the very place I ran from is the place I'm runnin' to

Another Saturday night singin' to the same ol' crowd
Still playin' this six-string but things are different nowI met one
Of those girls turn your whole world around girls
And wouldn't you know it
We got our eyes on a house 'bout a hundred miles south
Out in Podunk

(2nd Chorus:)
Goodbye, her daddy looked me in the eye
And said go where you gotta go son but don't forget to call home
And her momma cried sadi keep Jesus in your life and we hugged her one last time
Then we headed down the road to start a family of our own

I could live with losing everything

Will burn out, you're wrong

Those lines that we were crossing, carelessly tossing caution to the wind,
Were wearing thin.

What a mess we made of that, now I'm not sure that I would want it back

It was fast and it was fun, the beginning of the end of us

One day that road just ran out, but I still travel down it now and then
And once again...

Well Bill got a promotion
He knocked Joe back down
Now Joe's everybody's long lost friend (laugh)
He's back in the crowd

Guess who's the new talk of the town
The new S.O.B.
The one everybody loves cuttin' down
Man it's a sight to see
They all smile right to his face, and hide the jealousy
Me I'm just working hard to get to that place,
Where everybody hates me

Well everybody wants to be the big dog
Wanna wag that big dog tail
But till they are they wanna see the big dog fail

You pay your dues and you get your breaks
Then your the S.O.B.
The one everybody loves to hate
It just comes naturally
They all smile right to your face, and hide the jealousy
That's just the way it goes and I can't wait

He'd cover up his ears
He thought ""good boys don't cry""
He fought back all the tears
Mama'd use her makeup
For the bruises on her face
In the morning they'd pretend
That there'd never ever
Been a trace

His old man woke him up
To help him find the car
Take the bus uptown
Outside some run down bar
Swore that he was quitting
And then he'd start to cry
And though the boy knew the truth
Sometimes he's still believe that lie

When the sins of the father
Are the sins of the son
All you do is crawl when
You wanna run
But God gave boys their mamas
'Cause they always see their promise
And they help them understand
How to walk like a man, walk like a man

They moved a lot of places
They never settled down
It got pretty old being the new kid in town
He'd always tell his friends ""My daddy's sick today""
Said he'd be rich if he had a nickel every time
He heard his mama say

When the sins of the father
Are the sins of the son
Gotta crawl before you walk boy
Walk before you run
Come on now stand up straight
I'm proud of you
Take my hand, I know you can
Walk like a man, walk like a man

In a Dodge van with no exhaust,

Started a band and I met a girl,
Sang my songs and rocked her world,
Goin' strong but out of the blue one day,
She said ""I can't love a music man"",
So I dropped my dream and sold my amp,
But I'll be damned if she didn't leave me anyway.

So I stared a band, with a couple new guys,
We played those same ol' dives.

But the lead picker always played too loud,
And him and the drummer had a fallin' out,
Bass man stayed out of it and just got drunk,
I was Nashville bound, my dreams were bigger,
I knocked 'em out they just couldn't pull the trigger,
And that's Nashville speak for I stunk, as a solo man.

So I started a band, we play what we like,

In search of a handsome companion because
She had just broken up with a clown

Now the with one graceful aerial flip he was smitten
With her and her little tutu
Standing there love struck, why he almost stumbled
Into the elephants doing their tricks
And the ringmaster tipped his top hat and said
Son, bid adieu to your heart
And his words rang true right there under the bleachers
Soon after that big top went dark

Now, the old bearded lady, she whispered 'be careful'
On the train to the very next town
And the handful of midgets who ride unicycles
Peddled by with one smile and four frowns
So he had a vague sense of uneasiness when
His new sweetheart opened the door
And he knew when he saw the clown standing behind her
In front of her, there stood one more

Now, I can't say for sure if it was Barnum or Bailey
To whom I handed the note

No, I have no objection
I do, I do, I want him outta my life

I need some morcaine
Throw the bouquet
Pass the champagne
Its time to celebrate
I'm gonna dance this night away

O this is perfect
It can only get better
There fighting in the car
Off to a real good start
