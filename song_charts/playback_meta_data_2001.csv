0,1,Lonestar,"He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
And when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
She said Daddy when you coming home?
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said, I really miss you darlin'
Don't worry about the kids
They'll be all right
Wish I was in your arms
Lyin' right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there to the end
Can you feel the love that I share?
Oh I'm already there

We may be a
Thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you
Wherever you are

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair

1,2,Aaron Tippin,"Well, if you ask me where I come from
Here's what I tell everyone
I was born by God's dear grace
In an extraordinary place
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

It's a big ol' land with countless dreams
Happiness ain't out of reach
Hard work pays off the way it should
Yeah, I've seen enough to know that we've got it good
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

There's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

I pledge allegiance to this flag
And if that bothers you, well, that's too bad
But if you got pride and you're proud you do
Hey, we could use some more like me and you
Where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly

Yes, there's a lady that stands in a harbor for what we believe
And there's a bell that still echoes the price that it cost to be free

No, it ain't the only place on earth
But it's the only place that I prefer
To love my wife and raise my kids
Hey, the same way that my daddy did

2,3,Blake Shelton,"She left without leaving a number 
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin 
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year 
Before she called him up,
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If your calling 'bout the car, I sold it,
If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling
If you got something to sell
Your wasting your time
I'm not buying
If it's anybody else
Wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin 
I still love you.

The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kinda man would hang on that long
What kinda love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night,
I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake 
And I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back
When I get home 
On Sunday afternoon,
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

This time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone
On Sunday evening
And this is what he hear

If you're calling 'bout my heart
It's still yours
I shoulda listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have
Taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell this is Austin
And I still love you
...I still love you",,,,,,,,

The moment that your lips touched mine
Something shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time

There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

You shouldn't kiss me like this

7,8,Alan Jackson,"Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or workin' on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Risin' against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?

Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out in pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doin' what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things He gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turnin' on that September day?
Teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?

Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?

Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you
The difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God

8,9,Diamond Rio,"Last night I had a crazy dream
A wish was granted just for me,
It could be for anything
I didn't ask for money
Or a mansion in Malibu
I simply wished, for one more day with you.

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you.

--- Instrumental ---
One more day.

First thing I'd do, is pray for time to crawl
I'd unplug the telephone
And keep the TV off
I'd hold you every second
Say a million I love you's
That's what I'd do, with one more day with you.

One more day
One more time
One more sunset, maybe I'd be satisfied
But then again
I know what it would do
Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you.

It took me by surprise
When I saw you standin' there
Close enough to touch
Breathin' the same air
You asked me how I'd been

Oh, but baby I was lyin'

What I really meant to say

There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you

And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held on to my pride and watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know

What I really meant to say

There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth

And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother.
Like ice cream melting, they embraced,
Years of bad decisions running down her face.
All mornin' I'd been thinking my life's so hard,
And they wore everything they owned, living in a car.
I wanted to tell 'em it would be okay,
But I just got in my Suburban and I drove away.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.

Keep having this dream about my old man,
I'm ten years old and he's holding my hand.
We're talking on the front porch
Watching the sun go down,
But it was just a dream.
He was a slave to his job
And he couldn't be around.
So many things I want to say to him,
But I just placed a rose on his grave,
And I talked to the wind.

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry.

I'm sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life.
We say grace, and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for.
Then its up the stairs and off to bed
And my little girl says,
""I haven't had my story, yet.""
And everything weighing on my mind disapears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says,
""I love you, dad!""

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry.

Shouldn't have to be this rough

I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue.

Poured out my best home brew.

As she packed her things to leave.

She changed direction, headed out west.
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess.

And her pretty blue eyes went to green. 
She changed everything when she couldn't change me.

She was sittin' beside the ocean,
Lookin' out at the waves.
Watchin' how they keep on rollin',
They always seem the same.
She called and said she'd been thinkin' about,
All those quiet country nights.
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me,
Suddenly seemed all right.

When her truck pulled into view.
She said: ""I changed my mind when I couldn't change you.""

And the bluest eyes you ever seen.

When an ad that said ""Old Chevy"" somehow caught my eye
The lady didn't know the year or even if it ran
But I had that thousand dollars in my hand

It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green army tarp
And when I pulled the cover off, it took away my breath
What she called a Chevy was a sixty-six Corvette

And I felt a little guilty as I counted out the bills
But what a thrill I got when I sat behind the wheel
I opened up the glove box, and that's when I found the note

He said, ""My name is Private Andrew Malone

With so far to go
Headlights keep coming
Loneliness humming along

Who poured this rain?
Who made these clouds?
I stare through this windshield
Thinking out loud
Time keeps on crawling
Love keeps on calling me home

I'd jump all these mountains
And take to the skies
Sail through the heavens
With stars in my eyes

If my heart had wings
I would fly to you
And lie beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings

We both committed
We both agreed
You do what you have to
To get what you need
Feelin' you near me with so many miles in between

Lord it ain't easy
Out here in the dark
To keep us together so far apart

If my heart had wings
I would fly to you
And lie beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings

Stuck on this circle
Spinnin' 'round
Cut loose from this rope
That's tying me down

If my heart had wings
I would fly to you
And lie beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings

If my heart had wings
I would fly to you
And lie beside you as you dream
If my heart had wings",,,,,,,,

Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things

That Miss Emma Tucker was the one

And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be

Lands on the face of a dream come true

Just another normal thing I've come to expect

It's ordinary, plain, and simple
Typical, this everyday love
Same ol', same ol' keeping it new

Emotional, so familiar
Nothing about it too peculiar
Oh, but I can't get enough of this everyday love

Every afternoon I make a phone call
Listen to the voice that warms my heart
I drag myself through a few more hours
Then head on home to try and beat the dark
Her smile will be right there when I step through that door
And it will be that way tomorrow, just like everyday before

Wouldn't change one single thing about it

About to choke on my own blue collar

Misled by the grand illusion
I've come to this conclusion
I can't make a move too fast
It was written in the sky today
By the morning sun it sure looks like a good day to run

Wide open down a two-lane highway
It's about time that some things went my way
Throwing troubles out to the wind and
I'm praying that they never catch up again
I'm gonna say my worrying days are done
And this looks like a good day to run

She didn't get a vacation this past year
Now it won't be long
We don't need no destination
Just a tank of gas and a good clear station

Some things we ain't done

Placed my palm on your head

Laid our baby across your breast

In the Gulf of Mexico

Get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back then

I guess I'll just stay out here
Till I know the coast is clear
Sit and watch the tide roll in

There's a peace in the way I feel
When the water's still
And as long as its calm out here
I've got time to kill
But as soon as it starts to stir
I'll loose track of the way things were
Float away on the open air

An empty house deepens desire for true companionship
When he sees himself in the mirror, he don't look no younger
He just keeps on fightin' the fear that'll he'll go through life

Oh the hunger, the need for lovin' arms
Oh the hunger, longing for contentment of the heart

Anything that she can do to fill the empty hours

He looked through the screen at the back porch door, 
And he saw Andy lyin' on the floor,
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake.

Georgia patrol was making their rounds, 
So he fired a shot just to flag them down. 
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said ""Why'd you do it?""

She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own

Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night

Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

She'd find the peace to make her life complete

That someone took a brush and painted their hearts
Together they made such a beautiful thing

Flight 709 pulled up to the gate
An hour and 45 minutes late
And of course our connection was already in the air
Spent a day of our vacation in Chicago O'Hare
And like musical chairs at the baggage belt
We were the last ones standin' there when nothin' came out
Looking back now on our string of bad luck
That just wasn't our day but you know what?

That one night in Las Vegas
Lyin' there with you
Was well worth everything that you and I went through

And so it goes, our life's been that way
Puttin' out fires, takin' it day by day
And look at this year, it's been our hardest one yet
Just when we thought it had gotten bad as it could get
You got transferred to Denver, I stayed behind
Put the house on the market 'bout went outta my mind
And your dad got sick, I've never seen you so scared
We almost didn't make it through the year

But that weekend in the mountains
In a cabin all by ourselves
Makin' that one memory made up for everything else

Ooh me and my insecurities
You and your stubborn pride
If we've learned anything it's there's no winner when we fight

So this mornin' in our kitchen
After talkin' all night long
We finally stopped tryin' to figure out
Who's right and who is wrong
And when you hold me like you're holdin' me
And I kiss your tired face
We know we took the long way here
But wound up in a better place
