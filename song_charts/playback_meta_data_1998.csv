0,1,Tim McGraw,"You always had an eye for things that glittered
But I was far from being made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no

Just like when you were leaving Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
And I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
'Cause leavin' didn't hurt me near as badly
As the tears I saw rollin' down your face

And yesterday I knew just what you wanted
When you came walkin' up to me with him
So I told you that I was happy for you
And given the chance I'd lie again

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
When all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile

Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to

1,2,Faith Hill,"I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry
No, I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby, 'Hello' Oh no, 'Goodbye'
But you got me like a rocket 
Shootin' straight across the sky

It's the way you love me
It's a feelin' like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss
Unstoppable
This kiss, this kiss

'How does love get so off course?
Oh, all I wanted was a white knight 
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse'

This kiss, this kiss
Unsinkable
This kiss, this kiss

You can kiss me in the moonlight
On a rooftop under the sky
Oh, you can kiss me with the windows open 
While the rain comes pouring inside.
Oh, kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let everything slide
You've got me floating, you've got me flying

It's the way you love me

Watch you smile while you're sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

I don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
And then I kiss your eyes, and thank God we're together
For the first time but the sooner and the better

3,4,Dixie Chicks,"Who doesn't know what I'm talking about?
Who's never left home? Who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own?
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the highest stakes

She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

She needs wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces
She knows the highest stakes
She knows the highest stakes

As her folks drive away, her dad yells, ""check the oil""
Mom stares out the window and says, ""I'm leaving my girl""
She said it didn't seem like a-that long ago
When she stood there and let her own folks know 

She needed wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces

Outside of Boulder
He said he had to find himself
Out on the road
I guess when love goes wrong
You've gotta learn to be strong
So I worked two jobs and I moved three times
I ended up south of Memphis
Workin' down in Riverside
I may not be so lucky in love
But the one thing I'm sure of

I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that wanna hold me
Not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart
Stand beside me
Be true
Don't tell lies to me
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me

I didn't expect to see him
One hot July mornin'
His hair was longer but his eyes
Were the same old blue
He said, I've missed you for so long
Oh baby, what can I do?

I said, I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that wanna hold me
Not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart

It's hard to tell him no when I want him so bad

Than waking up without you here

She's a mouthful of anything and everything a man could want
She ain't typical, she's unpredictable, she's available, it's a miracle
How my heart stumbled into someone so kissable, huggable, lovable,
Unbelievable

Up till now my life has been so lonely and boring
I never thought I would find someone so

Elegant, intelligent, heaven sent, all my money spent
I put a big down payment on that itty bitty diamond ring

Got-to-havable

At half past a heartache at quarter to four

If you told me some lies, it would be like old times
Just getting to see you is almost worth the things you do.

You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye 
Before this goes too far
'Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart.

I got to admit to you got a smile
That really reeled me in for awhile
But it ain't funny, honey, what you put me through
So why don't you send me your photograph
It'd hurt a lot less than taking you back
Then I could still have my favorite part of you.

I ought to be flying but I'm sittin' here at this green light
I thought I was in control, thought I knew where I wanted to go
She's got me turned inside out, I'm wonderin' what it's all about

Is she there in your dreams? I don't know, I can't sleep
Is she breaking your heart? Yeah, but isn't it sweet?
Does she know how you feel? It's right on the tip of my tongue
Are you walking on air? Well I'm sure feeling tall
Does she trouble your mind? It's no trouble at all
Oh I don't know but something tells me it must be love.

I just missed my turn, guess I'm not thinking straight
Oh and what's with this car, it's driving me back to her place
I'm out here circling around, I've already covered this ground

How fast this good old boys world got better
The sky got bluer, the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her

Like my, favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She's, right on the money
She goes direct, to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Bulls eye perfect
She's, right on the money

She's no red lights, when I've over slept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothin' but net
A hand full of aces when the dealers done dealin'
I'm forever on a roll that's how she's, got me feelin'

She's, right on the money
She goes direct, to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Bulls eye perfect
She's, right on the money

She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

She's, right on the money
She goes direct, to my heart

23,24,Randy Travis,"He was 16, tender and tough.
She was too, and he'd do anything to prove his love.
With so much riding on the choice at hand,
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man.

Hearts caught fire and love ran wild.
She cried the day she called to say she was having his child.
With so much riding on the choice at hand,
The spirit of a boy or the wisdom of a man.

There's a constant contradiction, what feels good and what feels right.
But, you live with decisions that you make in your life.
And what steers your direction is hard to understand,
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man

Now he drives a diesel out of Dallas,
Hauling cars out to the coast.
It ain't the dream that he remembered, just a few short years ago.
But tonight at a truckstop, while drinking a cup,
The waitress grins and winks at him,
And says, ""My shift's almost up.""
With so much riding on the choice at hand,
The spirit of a boy, or the wisdom of a man.

That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner,
Every face I'd see you
So with nothing more than a tank of gas
I drove away without looking back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
Going anywhere as fast as I can

Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock,
But a long way from over you

These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are
Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
But I'm still a far cry from gone

26,27,The Wilkinsons,"She sat all alone on a bus out of Beaumont
The courage of just 18 years
A penny and quarter were taped to a letter
And momma's goodbye in her ears

She watched as her high school faded behind her
And the house with the white picket fence
Then she read the note that her momma had wrote
Wrapped up with 26 cents

When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And only your momma's love

A penny and a quarter buys a whole lot of nothing
Taped to an old wrinkled note
And when she didn't have much she had all momma's love
Inside that old envelope

When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts

But when she holds the coins she feels her love just as strong

It would make my dreams come true

And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

""One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might've been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
Maybe even cry a little but

Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should've seen right through me

Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away
And I still see her in my dreams

You knew all my tricks
You knew how to heal that pain no medicine can fix

And I bless the day I met you
And I thank God that he let you
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on

And the good news is I'm better
For the time we spent together
And the bad news is you're gone

Looking back it's still surprisin'
I was sinking, you were risin'
With a look you caught me in mid-air

Now I know God has his reasons
But sometimes it's hard to see them
When I awake and find that you're not there

You found hope in hopeless
You made crazy sane
You became the missing link that helped me to break my chains

And I bless the day I met you
And I thank God that he let you
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on

And the good news is I'm better

Didn't think I had the courage
To stand upon this stage

Then you reached into my heart
And you found the melody
And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
It was you... it was you...

(Chorus) It was your song that made me sing
And it was your voice that made me wings
And it was your light that shined guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song

That I'll do my best and I won't let you down

It was a pitiful sight, me begging her to stay.

That she packed a punch that knocked my heart out cold?

Broke my heart like a little play toy,
Brought me to my knees from ten feet tall.
The night she left me in Amarillo
I cried crocodile tears in my pillow.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
How could a blue-eyed beauty only five-foot-three
Lay a Texas size heartache on me?

Now I'm a big ol' fool with a leaving lesson learned.

Said, I'm gonna tunnel me a mine

Got in too deep to see the diamonds
Down too dark to see the gold
Now he won't let go of the shovel
And he can't dig out of the hole

Deeper and deeper he's goin' down
Driving his future
Right into the ground
He thinks he's closer
The further he goes
But he's still on the bottom
And he can't dig out of the hole

I tried to throw the man a lifeline
I tried to send him down a rope
I don't think he hears me calling
But every day I pray and I hope
Somehow he finally gets the message
Every spade of dirt he throws
Only gets him close to the devil

Maybe this'll shine a little light

The line between wrong and right
Use the one chance you've been given
'Cause once you're in the ground and cold
It's too late to start livin'
You see you can't dig out of the hole

If I ever find my way back home.

Guess my homeless situation is partly my fault
For another thousand dollars down I could have bought
That house in the country that she loved so much
With all that brick and wood there ain't no way it would budge

You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might've been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
Maybe even cry a little but

But at 17, you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain

I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time.

And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor

And you broke my trust and you took advantage of my heart
And you left me here with empty rooms and walls with holes, scars and scratches,
If I find the strength to burn your memory down
At least you left the matches.

On the bank of the creek where we used to swim
A farmers son and a preachers only daughter
We ran bare foot throught the garden gate
All afternood we'd laugh and play
Till the sun went down on me and Emily Harper.

I noticed Emily's eyes were green
And how they shined when I made her laugh.

I hated other guys around.

When he caught me stealing my first kiss.

Splashing through the mud and the muck

'Til I can buy a wedding band""

About that sweet magnolia thyme
Black-eyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine.

The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's that Dixie Lullaby.

Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and just to say hello
All the shoes he'd meet.

Why are you so happy said the clean white buck
You got no reason to be happy Mr Time
And Willie would stop and just pop his rag
And sing a Dixie Lullaby.

With a honeysuckle wine

He got his rockin' rhythm roots
And country confused
He sang the yodelin' blues

So they worked all week
And they got it just right

Do you toss and turn to the morning light
Does the darkness help when you lie down with the truth?
How do you sleep at night?
Are you all alone or holding someone tight?
Do you see me when you close your eyes?
How do you sleep at night?

Now your side of the beds as cold as the lies that I believed
I'm at the point where I can't even trust you in my dreams
Did the way you left me leave you feelin' proud?

I walked out tonight on the woman I love
We got in a fight and I said I've had enough
I slammed the door and I headed
For a place I used to go
For a taste of freedom with some
Friends I used to know

They had the jukebox rockin'
The music turned up loud
I thought I'd fit right back with my old
Party crowd
Now I can't remember what
I came to find
I've been here all night with
Just one question on my mind

Are you having fun yet
Right now it's hard to tell
My head don't feel that good
This heartache hurts like hell
I think I might'a made a big mistake


If this is good as the good times get
I'm down to my last dime
It's closing time
Are we having fun yet

I'll be she's watching TV now
In my favorite chair
While I ride this barstool
Wishing I was there
In my wildest dreams

Sitting here and missing her and
Asking my old friends

For a Christmas truce had been declared
By both sides of the fight.

As we lay there in our trenches
The silence broke in two,
By a German soldier singing
A song that we all knew.

Though I did not know the language,
The song was Silent Night.
Then I heard my buddy whisper,
All is calm, all is bright.
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me,
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong
But I stood up in my trench,
And I began to sing along.

Then across the frozen battlefield,
Anothers voice joined in,
Until one by one each man became
A singer of the hymn.

Then I thought that I was dreaming
For right there in my sight,
Stood the German soldier
Neath the falling flakes of white.
The he raised his hand and smiled at me
As if he seemed to say
Here's hoping we both live
To see us find a better way

Then the devil's clock struck midnight
And the skies lit up again,
And the battlefield where heaven stood
Was blown to hell again

Collected stamps since he was 10 years old

The fancy full-length fur
Dom Perignon and French cuisine
Don't mean a thing to her
What good is her pedestal
When he works all though the night
So in time, she found a dance floor
And some arms to hold her tight

Now every night they dance with her to some brushes on a drum
A standup bass, and steel guitars, play a tune, she can hum
Ain't it sad, ain't it funny, how a man can be so wrong
He tried to buy her love with money
He could've had her for a song

She wanted him... but what a shame
He didn't realize
Love can never stay the same
It either grows or dies
What made him think his duty was to place her high above
He married her for beauty, she married him for love

Now every night they dance with her to some brushes on a drum

On a lazy, hot July

I will roll across these mountains
I will take the last train out

Roses, dust and ashes
Throw them where I lay
And if by chance you see me
There'll be no sorrow on my face

For I will see the beauty
I only wish that you could see
I'll leave my body weakened

Fall down from the sky
