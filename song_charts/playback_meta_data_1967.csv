She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall - that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low

Were foolish to cause me to cry

Is trembling as never before
My feelings I can't hide, resistance has all died
My pride will rush outside

The lips that have kissed her,
That's loved her and missed her
Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment, I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light
I thought of just taking these two hands and breaking
The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating, the woman I've wanted so much.

I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours
I put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling remembering
The way that she tosses her head.

I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to
Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it,
There's no way to hide it

I've just got time for one more round
Set 'em up my friend then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile and did awhile but it felt so out of place
Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops streaming down his face?

I think I'll have another round
Another one my friend then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town.

Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down.

I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm.

At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309.""

I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309.""

Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road.""

Well, he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low
And said: ""Have yourself a cup on old Big Joe.""
When Joe and his rig roared out in the night
In nothin' flat, he was clean out of sight.

Well, I went inside and ordered me a cup
Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up
Aw!, you coulda heard a pin drop, it got deathly quiet
And the waiter's face turned kinda white.

Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago.

At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel.

Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309

But, every now and then, some hiker'll come by
And like you, Big Joe'll give 'em a ride
Here, have another cup and forget about the dime
Keep it as a souvenir, from Big Joe and Phantom 309!""",Phantom 309,Phantom 309,1967,12,3:31,Track 'A1',Album,True

It was all so plain to see then
She'd dance all night with someone else
And leave him there with me

Set him free, set him free

And I don't care who knows

I'd respect him as a husband
And I'd treat him like a man
I know I can help him find more happiness

Holdin' hands like school kids in the summer August sun
Smilin' at the passing strangers on their way
And wishin' the end would never come
Then a flower lady sold me one red rose to give you
For your chestnut hair, just to make it shine
Then I held it close to me, and I whispered
Joli girl, when will you be mine

Then we stepped up to the first stand on the corner
For some coconut champagne
And a taxi driver cussed us, 'cause a blind man got his tip
And tapped ""thank you"" with his cane
And we ducked out of the rain into a dusty little shop
That traded books and fluffy hats, rings and beads
Then I held it close to me, and I whispered
Joli girl, you're all I need

Aw, Joli girl, please don't ask me how long I'll be stayin'
You and your dandy ship of dreams that we can share
Tomorrow is just another day, I'm maybe far away
Joli girl, I might be anywhere
So let's spread our blanket in the park and hold each other close
The night is coming on and soon we'll have to go

Doing work that never gets done
Hair, that's lost some of its beauty
By too many hours in the sun
Eyes, that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in her life
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife

Everyday has been uphill
We climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I want to stop
Lips, that are weary but tender
With love, that strengthens my life

My woman, my woman, my wife

Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control of my mind, and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

When she reaches that river

Give her that mansion up yonder

Tonight I am aching, my body is shaking
Tonight Carmen's coming back home
Tonight there'll be no room for tears in my bedroom
Tonight Carmen's coming back home.

Tonight as I stand here I notice my hand here
Is trembling as never before
My feelings I can't hide, resistance has all died
My pride will rush outside
The moment she walks through the door.

The lips that have kissed her,
That's loved her and missed her
Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment, I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light
I thought of just taking these two hands and breaking
The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating, the woman I've wanted so much.

I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours
I put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling remembering
The way that she tosses her head.

I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to
Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it,
There's no way to hide it
The love that I have for my wife.
