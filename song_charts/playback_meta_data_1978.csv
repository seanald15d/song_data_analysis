I wait alone in the heat
I know, know that you'll have your way
'Til you have to go home

Will a little more love bring a happy ending?
Will a little more love make it right?

Where, where did my innocence go?
How, how was a young girl to know?
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes
In the warmth of your arms, in the web of your lies

When he turned and left her there, his words: ""Goodbye"".
He heard her calling out to him, and as he walked, she cried:

""I've been true to you.

""And I've been blue for you,

Mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
If she did she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

The only thing that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

He often left her all alone but she didn't mind the staying home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she don't need those things to make her happy
And she didn't seem to notice that he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to daddy.

One morning we awoke just to find a note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as we began to read it our ears could not believe it
The words she had written there to daddy.

She said the kids are older now they don't need me very much
And I've gone in search of love I need so badly
I have needed you so long but I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home.

If she did, she never did say so to daddy

She said OK and then said don't you dare

I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman too
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do
I've tried hard to be what mama says is good
As I step into my womanhood

Shortly after midnight
She turned off the porch light
Walked into her bedroom all alone
She sat down and said well, Lord
God, I've been through hell, Lord
Wonderin' if I did right or wrong

I am a Christian Lord, but I'm a woman to
If you are listenin' Lord, please show me what to do

62,63,C.W. McCall,"Well, I had two weeks vacation comin', so I thought I'd drive down to Florida: spend some time with an old friend, date a few girls, make a few parties, and just kinda live it up again. 

So I packed up my car, and then I called my Mom in Tennesee, and told her what I planned to do. She said, ""Son, are you comin' by?"" And I said, ""Mom, I'm really pushed for time, but I'll see you in a week or two."" 

And I was drivin' through this little town in Georgia when I remembered: today's Mama's birthday. Well, I thought I'll just stop and wire some flowers. Shouldn't take too long; then I'll be on my way. 

So I walked in a flower shop and the first thing I saw was this little boy, with his eyes full a' tears. I said, ""What's wrong, son?"" He said, ""Mama loves roses. And today's her birthday, and I haven't seen her in almost a year.""

He said, ""I live with Grandma now. But I promised Mama some roses, 'cause I talk to her all the time. I wanted to give her five, 'cause that's how old I am. But the lady said I couldn't buy 'em with just a dime."" 

Well, the little fella's story kind a' touched my heart, so I told the lady to give him what he wanted and charge it to me. Then I told her I needed to wire a dozen roses to my Mama, up in Chapel Hill, Tennessee. 

I looked around, and the little boy was gone. But all of a sudden the door flew open and he come runnin' back in and he said, ""Mister, I forgot to thank you for the roses."" He smiled, he shook my hand, and ran back out again. 

Well, I started on out of town. And I was feelin' real proud of myself for thinkin' of my Mama and really carin', when I looked out the window and I saw that same little boy, kneelin', by a grave in an old cemetery. 

I stopped my car and walked over to where the little boy was kneelin' down. And he smiled up at me and said, ""This is where my Mama stays. She says she sure does thank you for these pretty roses."" Well that's when I had to walk away. 

And I drove straight back to that flower shop and I said, ""Lady, have you sent those flowers to Tennessee?"" She said, ""No, not yet."" I said, ""Well, nevermind. I'll just take them back with me.""

Dreaming the whole world is in her hands
What she thought was love last night
Was just the wine and the weakness in a man

But now the passion's gone and all that's left
Is cold gray facts and cold gray morning light
As I promptly close the door I wonder
What did I promise her last night

I guess I should have wakened her
And told her that I must be moving on
But I told myself the truth might hurt her
Worse than waking up to find me gone

But my conscience knows the truth
And it's so hard to convince myself I'm right
And as I slowly drive away
I wonder what did I promise her last night

I guess by now she's waking up
And packing up her things and heading home
With memories of a temporary love
She wishes never came along

How many one-night stands must she go through
Before she finds a love that right?

What did I promise her last night

And the lady he'd been seen with

She'll be glad to see her big time boy come home
She gets little in return for all she's given
And I'm all she's got to love since Daddy's gone.

Now I'm forty miles away and I'm still wonderin'
Why I ever told her I was doing well
When I first went wrong I should have turned to Momma
But it's hard to get back up once you have fell.

As I drive away behind me Momma's waving
To a son who's all she'd ever hoped he'd be
Now she says her final prayers, ""And go, meet Daddy""
And I'm glad she's only seen one side of me.

And tonight I'll walk these last few steps alone

Our God fearing mum and daddy raised us young 'uns on a song
By the banks where old new river gently sways and rolled along
Where once upon a time there dwelled a close knit mountain clan
An old time family blue grass band.

You never heard the like of melodies our family played
The guitar kept the rhythm as the fiddle sawed away
We recall a banjo ringing and a singing mandolin
In an old time family blue grass band.

Daddy slapped the upright, mamma strummed the other part
We couldn't read the music we just played it all by heart
Lord how those songs just flowed across that fertile mountain land
In an old time family blue grass band.

I see us sitting round the porch on starry summer nights
I remember how the music made my world seem good and right
When all the folks would raise their happy voices and join in
With the old time family blue grass band.

Well, we roared up offa that shoulder sprayin' pine cones, rocks, and boulders, and put four hundred head of them Rhode Island reds and a couple a' burnt-out roosters on the line. Look out below; 'cause here we go! 

Well, we commenced to truckin' and them hens commenced to cluckin' and then Earl took out a match and scratched his pants and lit up the unused half of a dollar cigar and took a puff. Says ""My, ain't this purdy up here."" 

I says, ""Earl, this hill can spill us. You better slow down or you gonna kill us. Just make one mistake and it's the Pearly Gates for them eight-five crates a' USDA-approved cluckers. You wanna hit second?""

He was tryin' to thread it on there when the fire fell off a' his cigar and dropped on down, sorta rolled around, and then lit in the cuff of Earl's pants and burned a hole in his sock. Yeah, sorta set him right on fire. 

I looked on outta the window and I started countin' phone poles, goin' by at the rate of four to the seventh power. Well I put two and two together, and added twelve and carried five; come up with twenty-two thousand telephone poles an hour. 

I looked at Earl and his eyes was wide, his lip was curled, and his leg was fried. And his hand was froze to the wheel like a tongue to a sled in the middle of a blizzard. I says, ""Earl, I'm not the type to complain; but the time has come for me to explain that if you don't apply some brake real soon, they're gonna have to pick us up with a stick and a spoon."" 

Well, Earl rared back, and cocked his leg, stepped as down as hard as he could on the brake, and the pedal went clear to the floor and stayed there, right there on the floor. He said it was sorta like steppin' on a plum. 

Well, from there on down it just wasn't real purdy: it was hairpin county and switchback city. One of 'em looked like a can full'a worms; another one looked like malaria germs. Right in the middle of the whole damn show was a real nice tunnel, now wouldn't you know? 

Sign says clearance to the twelve-foot line, but the chickens was stacked to thirteen-nine. Well we shot that tunnel at a hundred-and-ten, like gas through a funnel and eggs through a hen, and we took that top row of chickens off slicker than scum off a Lousiana swamp.

Well, I kicked the tires and I got in the seat and set on a petrified apple core and found a bunch of field mice livin' in the glove compartment. He says, ""Her shaft is bent and her rear end leaks, you can fix her quick with an oily rag. Use a nail as a starter; I lost the key. Don't pay no mind to that whirrin' sound.

I says, ""What'll take?"" He says, ""What've you got?"" I says, ""Twenty-eight dollars and fifteen cents."" He says, ""You got a deal. Sign here, I'll go get the title and a can full of gas."" I put the nail in the slot and fired 'er up; she coughed and belched up a bunch a' smoke and I backed her right through the hog pen into the yard.

Kickin' tires, and swattin' flies,
And discussin' the State of the Union
When right out in front of the Baptist church
Come a big ol' purple school bus
Had astrological signs upon it
And thirty-five hippies and dogs inside
About half of 'em went for the courthouse lawn
And them dogs commenced on the fireplug
Rest of 'em set there starin' at us
And I says, ""Roy, go get your Flit gun""
He says, ""Which is the hippies? And which is the dogs?""
I says, ""Beats the hell outta me, Roy.""
What they was, was a bunch a' them Crispy Critters
And their leader was a space cadet 

He says, ""Sagittarius, we has arrived.
Prepare to disembark, men.
Get the incense goin' and the sitar out
We gonna camp in the city park, man."" 

I says, ""Boys, let me explain the situation to ya.
A: you're gettin' me down
And B: we got us a leash law here
And C: you in the wrong town.
You drop one string a' beads in that there park
And you gonna see a whole lotta stars.
You got fifteen seconds to get out of town, boys,
Or we gonna blow ya ta Mars."" 

Well, they all got back in the purple bus
And proceeded to the city limits.
Then the telephone rang, was the swimmin' pool
Says a mess a' wild Critters was in it!
So we all got in the Marshal's Plymouth
(Which is always at the Conoco station)
Went flashin' on down to the swimmin' pool 
To give them Critters a citation 

By the time we arrived, it was too damn late
Them critters is all had their pants down
Them dogs was tearin' the bathhouse apart,
And they's after the fish in the fish pond!
I says, ""Roy, you get the one in the silver T-shirt
""And I'll get the rest with a net.
We gonna have a jail full a' naked Crispy Critters 
And a drip-dry space cadet."" 

Well, we gave 'em hell, but we lost the war
'Cause them Critters outnumbered us
So they moved in and set up camp
And they lived in that purple school bus
Six weeks later, there was nothin' in town
But eighty-four dogs and a head shop
Sellin' dried up weeds, and sunflower seeds,
And astrological postcards 

Yeah, Critters took over the City Council

374,N/A,C.W. McCall,"Me an' RJ an' the kids was on a camp-out in the mountains, and we had us one'a them U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep cars which we rented from a fella by the name of Kubozke for thirty bucks a day, buy your gas along the way, take a rabbit's foot and leave a pint of blood for a dee-posit.

And he 'splained it all to us how we was supposed to get to Telluride, which is fifty miles away by way of the regular highway, however, there was a shortcut but unless we had drove the Black Bear Road before, we'd better be off to stay, stay in bed and sleep late. (Pay no attention to the gitar there.)

Well, we took up off'n the highway and we come upon a sign says ""Black Bear Road. You don't have to be crazy to drive this road, but it helps."" I says, ""RJ, this must the shortcut road Kubozke was talkin' about."" She didn't pay no mind, 'cause she was makin' peanut butter sandwiches for the kids in the back seat throwin' rocks and drinkin' Kool-Aid and playin' count-the-license-plates. But they wasn't havin' too much fun a-countin' license plate or cars, 'cause there weren't no other cars.

We went about a mile-and-a-half in about four hours, busted off the right front fender, tore a hole in the oil pan on a rock as big as a hall closet. Went over a bump and spilt the Kool-Aid and Roy Gene stuck his bolo knife right through the convertible top and the dog threw up all over the back seat. Peanut butter don't agree with him, you see.

So we had to stop and take off the top and air everything out and clean it up. The dog run off and RJ says she felt her asthma comin' on. I was sittin' there wonderin' what to do when the en-tire scenic San Joo-wan U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep car sank in the mud. At thirteen thousand feet above sea level.

Well, we shoveled it out and ate our lunch, the dog made a yellow hole in the snow and Roy Gene got out his Instamatic and took a snapshot of it. Mary Elizabeth drawed a picture of the road; it looked like a whole bunch a' Zs and Ws all strung together. And RJ took one look at it and said that the only way that Jeep car is goin' down that road is over her dead body. Then a rock slipped out from under the wheel and the U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep car went right over the edge of the cliff. Yahoo-ooh-ooh-ooh!

""Doggone-it, Roy Gene! How many times do I have to 'splain it to you? When I tell you to put a rock under the wheel, I mean rock! Now look at that, what you have there is no bigger'n a grapefruit.""",Black Bear Road,C.W. McCall's Greatest Hits,1978,12,2:00,Track 'B4',Single,False
375,N/A,C.W. McCall,"One night last summer we were camped at ten thousand feet up where the air is clear, high in the Rockies of Lost Lake, Colorado. And as the fire burned low and only a few glowing embers remained, we laid on our backs all warm in our sleeping bags and looked up at the stars. 

And as I felt myself falling into the vastness of the Universe, I thought about things, and places, and times. 

I thought about the time my grandma told me what to say when I saw the evening star. You know, Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight. I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.

The air is crystal-clear up here; that's why you can see a million stars. 

I remember a time a bunch of us were in a canyon of the Green River in Wyoming; it was a night like this. And we had our rafts pulled up on the bank an' turned over so we could sleep on 'em, and one of the guys from New York said, ""Hey! Look at the smog in the sky! Smog clear out here in the sticks!"" And somebody said, ""Hey, Joe, that's not smog; that's the Milky Way."" 

Joe had never seen the Milky Way. 

And we saw the Northern Lights once, in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. They're like flames from some prehistoric campfire, leaping and dancing in the sky and changing colors. Red to gold, and blue to violet... Aurora Borealis. It's like the equinox, the changing of the seasons. Summer to fall, young to old, then to now. And then tomorrow... 

And then everyone was asleep, except me. And as I saw the morning star come up over the mountains, I realized that life is just a collection of memories. And memories are like starlight: they go on forever.",Aurora Borealis,C.W. McCall's Greatest Hits,1978,12,3:24,Track 'B6',Single,False

Your lips are as soft as ever
And so is your hair
But still the thrill is gone
Because another has been there
It breaks my heart to walk away
From one I need so desperately
Oh I'd love to live with you again
But then I couldn't live with me.

'Cause she never called me from Dallas only when there's something wrong
Then she'll tell me the things she remembers and it's funny how time sure does fly
I'll bet you it's raining in Dallas 'cause I feel a tear in her eye

Sometimes she's lonely that's when she cries
Sometimes she's sorry that she said goodbye
Lord she's had too much to remember and her memories are too much to hide

But when your eyes met mine I knew I would
Sometimes at night my conscience makes me suffer

'Cause she's the one that made me need someone
And you're the one that gave me everything I wanted
So don't worry if it bothers me 'cause we both know it should

Yes, she's the one that made me need someone

537,N/A,Gene Watson,"Since the day I met you I've been living in a dream
Knowing all the while our love was wrong
And all the times you mentioned him were you and part between
I knew we could never love for long

I shouldn't give a second thought of how it might have been
I shouldn't even miss you when you're gone
I knew the day would come and you'd go running back to him
I knew we could never love for long

I knew at times you missed him 'cause I heard you when you cried
I guess that he was always on your mind
But I thought that I could take it when you finally said goodbye
Oh how could I have ever been so blind

I could never blame you 'cause I knew it from the start
You never really tried to lead me on
So tell me why this empty feeling's tearing me apart
When I knew we could never love for long

So tell me why this empty feeling's tearing me apart
When I knew we could never love for long",I Knew We Could Never Love For Long,Gene Watson's Beautiful Country,1977,10,2:41,Track 'B4',LP,False

(He little thing'd her out of my arms.)

I brought her a mansion he gave her some flowers
I turned her to riches he turned on the charm
I showed her Paris he showed her a sunset
He little thing'd her out of my arms.

I always thought she knew I loved her
Though I never told her so
And when I told her he'd already stoled her
He little thing'd her out of my arms.
