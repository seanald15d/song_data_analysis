0,1,Kenny Rogers,"Evryone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow'
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun""

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin'
They took turns at Becky; there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:

""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you dont have to fight to be a man""

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! Ol' yellow's leavin'""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door

Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin'
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall
And I heard him say

""I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man""

1,2,Dolly Parton,"Tumble out of bed
And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition

Just a watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder

Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in

Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them,
With the words of a sad country song.
My heroes have always been cowboys.
And they still are, it seems.

Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery,
From being alone too long.
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare,
Knowin' well that your best days are gone.
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen,
I let the words of my years fade away.
Old worn-out saddles, and 'old worn-out memories,
With no one and no place to stay.

By the light of the radio by my bed with Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head

When I was in school I ran with a kid down the street
And I watched him burn himself up on Bourbon and speed

Lost to James Dean and rock and roll
I knew down deep in my country soul
That I had to get away

Hollywood was a lady in red
Who danced in my dreams
As I tossed in bed
I knew I'd wind up
In jail or dead
If I had to stay

I thought happiness
Was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
My momma kept calling me home
But I just did not want to hear her
And the vision was getting clearer
In my dreams

So I laid out one night in June
Stoned on the glow of the Texas moon
Humming an old Buddy Holly tune
Called Peggy Sue

With my favorite jeans
And a cheap guitar

I ran off chasing a distant star
If Buddy Holly could make it that far
I figured I could too

And I thought happiness
Was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
My momma kept calling me home
But I just did not want to hear her
And the vision was getting clearer
In my dreams

But the Hollywood moon didn't
Smile the same old smile
That I'd grown up with
The lady in red
Just wanted my last dime

And I cried myself to sleep at night
Too dumb to run, too scared to fight
And too proud to admit it at the time

So I got me some gigs on Saturday nights
Not much more than orchestrated fights
I'd come home drunk and I'd try to write
But the words came out wrong

Hell bent and bound for a wasted youth
Too much gin and not enough vermouth
And no one to teach me
How to seek the truth
Before I put it into song

I still thought happiness
Was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
My momma kept calling me home
But I just could not, would not hear her
And the vision was getting clearer
In my dreams

Well, I thank God each and every day
For giving me the music and words to say
I'd-a never made it any other way
He was my only friend

Now I sleep a little better at night
When I look in the mirror
In the morning light
The man I see was both wrong and right
He's going home again

I guess happiness was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
But now happiness is Lubbock, Texas
Growing nearer and dearer
And the vision is getting clearer
In my dreams

We trembled as the thunder rolled
Across the West Texas plains

We watched the lightnin' flashin'
In sweet stormy skies
Reflectin' all the fire and passion
In our restless young eyes

And I was just a lost little child
In the body of a man
My blood was runnin' hot and wild
When her fingers touched my hand

And in the hot Texas night
She reached and took my tremblin' fingertips
And led them gently to her parted lips
And she moved her hips
And the world stood still

And the hot Texas night
Stood guard and shrouded us in secrecy
And as we came together hungrily
Suddenly, I knew the thrill

I faced the storm alone
And looked back over all the years
And the love that I've known

Suddenly I see her face
Silhouetted in the trees

Among my sweetest memories

And led them gently to her parted lips

And breezes blew from nothingness and herbs and grasses grew
And silent creatures roamed the Earth and multiplied their kind
And man was but a molecule that God had left behind.

We have grown we have grown, we have captured the throne
Of the kingdom God made for our winning. 
We have grown we have grown, but our children alone
Have so little time left for beginning.

And mountains sprang and chaos rang the overture of life
And rivers coursed the twisted blade of natures sharpest knife
And cut beneath the rolling dales a gateway to the sea
While tidal waves and mighty gales were heard in symphony
And sunshine fell upon the waves and warmed the virgin land
And from the mud a drop of blood was left upon the sand.

And perfect in his loneliness, a rib pulled from his chest
Formed a sweet companion of pulchritude and breast.
And from the tree of knowledge God said they could not eat.
And perfect was their paradise unto the serpent at their feet.

And I placed no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plan
The way Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close as she danced with me.

She said I've loved you for a long time
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger
I can't hide it any longer
And so I thought I'd better let you know.

Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon to be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her crying

I've decided not to give you a present this year
In fact I think it's about time I took some things away.

I'd like to take away the suspicion
That I know clouds your world at times
By giving you some faith to hold on to, honey
Whenever your hand is not in mine.

Happy birthday darling, I've no present, no fancy cake
But I hope I'll make you happy with everything I take.

I'd like to take away some of your lonely moments
By spending more time with you
And I'd like to take away some of those so, so kisses
And replace them with ones that really say, I love you.

And I want to take away the doubt 
You sometimes have about my love
By showing it more, much more than I've shown you lately
And then if someone should ask you 
What I got you for your birthday
Well you can say, why he didn't give me anything 
But he sure took a lot of things away.
