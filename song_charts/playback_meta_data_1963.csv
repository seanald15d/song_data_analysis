0,1,Bill Anderson,"(Still) though you broke my heart
(Still) though we're far apart
I love you still
(Still) after all this time
(Still) you're still on my mind
I love you still

I've lost count of the hours 
And I've lost track of the days  
In fact, I've lost just about everything 
Since you went away  
Everything, that is, except the memories you left me
And that's one thing that no one can mar  

I don't know who you're with 
I don't even know where you've gone  
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song 
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you  
And I love you, wherever you are

(Still) after all this time
(Still) you're still on my mind
I love you still

This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire 
For every day it burns hotter 
And every day it burns higher  
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker 
Not even with all of these tears  

My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am  
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can 
For some day, you might just decide to come home 
And I want you to know   
I'm still here

(Still) though you broke my heart
(Still) though we're far apart
I love you still",Still,Still,1963,2,2:45,Track 'A',Single,True
1,2,Bobby Bare,"Lord I'm five hundred miles away from home
Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home away from home cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home

I know this is the same road I took the day I left home
But it sure looks different now
Well I guess I look different too cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way

Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight

My lonely world is only eight by ten eight by ten eight by ten
I remember the night that you gave me that picture I ought to
I've relived it so many times I remember how I couldn't wait to get home
Put it in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine.

Because you were mine at least until someone else came along
And took you off out of my sight
It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture to hold
Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night.

It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame
But I'm jealous of anything that's close to you
And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight

I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame
And be so close to the lips that I love

As he'd tell of how he lived when he's a boy like me

'Bout how to become an all-American Boy.
Just buy you a guitar and put it in tune

I bought me a guitar about a year ago and I
Learned how to play it in a day or so.
And all around town it was well understood
That I was knocking 'em out like Johnny B. Goode.
Hot licks, showing off, ah, number one.
Well I practiced all day and up into the night,
My papa's hair was a gettin' kinda white.
He didn't dig that, ah, rock and roll.
He said, ""You can stay boy, but that's gotta go.""
He's a square; just didn't dig me at all.
So I packed my guitar, picks and all, bid farewell to my poor old pa.
I split for Memphis where they say 'you all'
And them swinging cats are a havin' a ball.
Yeah, they love me down there, guitar picks and all.
I was rocking and bopping and getting all the breaks,
And the girls all said that I had what it takes,
When up steps a man with a big cigar. He said. ""Come here, kid.
I'm gonna make you a star.""
Put you on ""Bandstand', buy you a cadillac. Sign here, kid.""
So I signed my name and became a star, having a ball with my guitar.
Driving a big, long cadillac. And fighting the girls off'n my back.
But they just keep a comin', screaming, they love it.
So I picked my guitar with a great big grin
And the money just kept on rollin' in.

Saying take a look at my girl's photograph

Oh, her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know

Dwells a lonely little maiden all alone
She is thinking of her true love though he's far across the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone

Then one day he whispered, ""Darling, I've come back
From Caroline, I've come back to claim the only girl I love""
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew
Gathered 'round and he wed his little Filipino baby

This brave young soldier would pledge her his love.

And he gave Rosana his yellow bandana
To wear in her hair till he's with her once more
He gave Rosana his yellow bandana

That the Apaches had burned the whole village down
And neath the tree where he'd last kissed Rosana
Gripped on the cross was his yellow bandana.

Then think of a church where nobody's praying
If you've ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you

Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing

If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you,
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone.

Over there, sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee
And whisper oh, I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never
Be the same without the love
That we once knew.

Straight ahead, that's the bed
Where we'd lay in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say good morning dear.

There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them
When she tore my world apart.

As you leave you'll see the nursery,

Taking nothing but
Our baby and my heart.

A couple gazes at the

As he says Honey that's for you
It's not much but it's the best that I can do

Golden ring with one tiny little stone
Waiting there for someone to take it home
By itself it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a little wedding chapel
Later on that after noon
An old up right piano
Plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low with this ring I thee wed

Shining ring now at last it's found a home

As they fight their final round

But I know you're leavin' town

I don't love you anymore

Listened to them grand old opry shows
Well, I cut my teeth on gospel songs and good old country fair
