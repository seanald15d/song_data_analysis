0,1,Lynn Anderson,"I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
When you take, you gotta give, so live and let live and let go, oh, oh, oh, oh
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well, if sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter?
So smile for a while and let's be jolly; love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden

I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You'd better look before you leap; still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly; love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometime

1,2,Elvis Presley,"There goes my only possession
There goes my everything

I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across the lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying
Darling this will be goodbye for evermore

There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything

What a handsome lad, that's my boy
B-R-L-F-Q spells mom and dad
Well that ain't too bad, 'cause that's my boy
Well you can have your TV and your nightclubs
And you can have your drive-in - picture show
I'll stay here with my little man near
We'll listen to the radio
Biding my time watching Scotty grow

Making a castle out of building blocks
And a cardboard box, that's my boy
Micky Mouse says it's thirteen o'clock
Well that's quite a shock, but that's my boy
In four short years I've gone from rags to riches
And what I did before that, I don't know
So let it rain on my windowpane
I got my own rainbow
And we're sitting here shining,
Watching Scotty grow

Riding on daddy's shoulders off to bed
Old sleepyhead, that's my boy
Gotta have a drink of water and a story read
A teddybear named Fred, that's my boy
What's that you say momma, come on and keep your feet warm?
Well save me a place I'll be there in a minute or so

All have to sit upon the ground, uum

The birds will walk around in underwear

So that is why I'm gonna say it one more time

Honey, come back I just can't stand

9,10,Tom T. Hall,"One time I spent a week inside a little country jail
And I don't guess I'll ever live it down
I was sittin' at a red light when these two men came and got me
And said that I was speeding through their town

Well, they said,""tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go.""
They let me call one person on the phone
I thought I'd be there overnight so I just called my boss
To tell him I'd be off but not for long

Well, they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys
One little barred up window in the rear
My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in
We ought to send the jailer for some beer

Well, I had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge
And the jailer's job was not the best in town
Later on his wife brought hot bologna, eggs and gravy
The first day I was there I turned it down

Well, next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early
Wonderin' when I'd get my release


Later on we got more hot bologna, eggs and gravy
And by now I wasn't quite so hard to please

Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten
The sheriff came in chewin' on a straw
He said, ""where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis? 
I'd like to talk to him about the law.""
Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady
And I really should be gettin' on my way
That part about me bein' who I was did not impress him
He said, ""the judge'll be here any day.""

The jailer had a wife and let me tell you she was awful
But she brought that hot bologna every day
And after seven days she got to lookin' so much better
I asked her if she'd like to run away

The next mornin' that old judge took every nickel that I had
And he said, ""son, let this teach you not to race.""

10,11,Johnny Cash,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound

It sure is cold today
And here I am'a walking down sixty-six
Wish she hadn't done me that way

Sleeping under a table at a road side park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleepin in our king size bed

Is anybody goin to San Antone
Or Pheonix Arizona
Anyplace is alright as long as I 
Can forget I've ever known her

Wind whipping down the neck of my shirt
Like I aint got nothing on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Than what I've been fighting at home

Yonder comes a truck with the US mail
People writing letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
But I'll still be just as gone

About the way we have to live here in this country
Harpin' on the wars we fight
And gripin' 'bout the way things oughta be

And standin' up for things they believe in
When they're runnin' down my country
They're walkin' on the fightin' side of me

If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singin' be a warnin'
If you're runnin' down my country, man
You're walkin' on the fightin' side of me

I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims he just don't believe in fightin'
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on bein' free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of livin'

In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.

My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a-hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And ever'thing would start all over come break of morn'.

Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain there was no need
She'd smile in Mommy's understanding way.

In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from sellin' a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.

Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well - the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we worked hard
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler.

To bother You with little things
And You and I have never been too close
But we've always been on speakin' terms
I've watched You with doin' things
And tried to understand You more than most

No, I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought You knew
In my own way I worshiped You
While even Your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way You go about the things You do

I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, You could have saved

But I believe that in your eyes
This little child was somethin' special
And You wanted it to be with You, no doubt
So without-stretched arms
You beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way You worked it out

Once I saw a young man growin'
Till he neared the age of knowin'
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at Your way of bein' kind

They tried everything in vain
And I was there when they explained it
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess You looked into the future
Watched him turn his back upon You
Lovin' him so much You couldn't take the chance

It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why You've never given up on me
You understood when some denied You
And even when they crucified You
Knowin' all these things were meant to be

63,64,Bill Anderson,"Where have all our heroes gone
What's come over our great land
America is still my home sweet home
But where have all our heroes gone?

I saw a group of boys the other day
Standing in the corner of a playground
Looking and laughin' at a magazine
And I overheard one of the boys
Said man is he ever cool
And he pointed to the man
Who's picture was on the magazine cover
And everybody kinda said under their breath
Yeah, he's cool alright.

And I got sick to my stomach
Because I'd seen the cover
And the man that they were talking about 
Had instigated a riot in one of our major cities last summer
And the magazine was writing
About how the police were unkind to him
The judges were not fair with him
And how he talked back and slung
His long hair about and cussed
And did his things and they made him into a regular hero.

And inside this magazine was the story of a baseball player
Who got involved with the gamblers
Of the football player who said that football was not the end
Just a means to an end. meanin' the girls and the good times
And a story of a folk singer who proudly claims 
To be both a member of a party ailen
To our government and a nontax payin' citizen.

These young boys read with open eyes and open minds
And I thought to myself my God
Are these the people that these young boys look up to
Are these their idols, are these the heroes
Of the now generation?

(America is still my home sweet home)
(But where have all our heroes gone?)

I had heroes when I was a kid, we all did
And our heroes did their thing too 
Like General Douglas McArthur
Who returned like he said he would
Like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers
Who chased the bad guys right off the screen
Like Lindberg who flew the ocean
And Jesse Owens who showed Hitler
And John Wayne and Gerry Cooper
After all didn't they really win the war
And General Ike bless your soul
'Cause he made us feel safe.

We've killed some of our recent heroes
The Kennedys and Kings
And even as great as their space feats are
How many of the astronauts can you name huh how many
My heroes were people like Joe DiMaggio
Who proved that nice guys can finish first
And Stan Musian who never had an unkind word for anybody
And Winston Churchill who's two fingers
Raised together meant victory.

Not just a let-your-enemy-have-it-all kind of artificial peace
This country needs a lotta things today friends
But it doesn't need any one thing anymore
Than it needs some real heroes.

Men who know what it means
To be looked up to by a griny faced kid
Men who wanna sign autograph books
And not deal under the table
Men who are willing to play the game
With the people who made them heroes
Men who don't mind putting on a white hat
And saying thank you and please
I wish I knew more men that I'd be proud of
For my son to look up to and say
Daddy when I grow up I want to be just-like-him.

You need the love that only I can give

Yes, sun and the rain, well they took everything
'Cept the dirt that would fly in my face
I swore that someday that I'd find me a way
To take me away from this place.

I packed up my belongings for soon
I'd be goin' far off to start a new life
And I'd better hurry or I'd have to worry
About those dark clouds in the sky.

As I reached the gate and turned to take one last look
At the old homeplace where I was born
I thought I could hear voices callin' to me
But then I thought no that just must be the storm.

I couldn't get over the feelin' something was wrong
That I was leavin' something behind
I couldn't put my finger on it
But I couldn't get that off my mind.

It seemed as if the wind was mama's and papa's voices
And that they were pleading with me to stay
And that the rain was tears that the skies were shedding Because I was goin' away.

But then like a bolt of lightnin' from out the blue
Oh, that feelings got over me like a flood
And for the very first time in my life, I knew
I had black Texas dirt in my blood.

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other
True as the stars above!
'Cause he was her man
But he done her wrong!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel
Just casually glanced into a window so high
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!""

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!""
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!""",Frankie And Johnny,One Minute Past Eternity,1969,2,1:56,Track 'B',Single,False

Through the neon darkened corridors

Never speaking to a soul.

Has the dirty smell of dyin'

And stops inside the Golden Crown

Tonight Carmen's coming back home
Tonight there'll be no room for tears in my bedroom
Tonight Carmen's coming back home.

Tonight as I stand here I notice my hand here
Is trembling as never before
My feelings I can't hide, resistance has all died
My pride will rush outside
The moment she walks through the door.

The lips that have kissed her,
That's loved her and missed her
Are lips that have cursed her at night
In anguish and torment, I've cursed as the night went
From darkness till dawn's golden light
I thought of just taking these two hands and breaking
The body I'm waiting to touch
I find while I'm waiting, there's no time for hating
While anticipating, the woman I've wanted so much.

I've placed pretty flowers to brighten the hours
I put brand new sheets on the bed
I'm nervous, I'm trembling, recalling remembering
The way that she tosses her head.

I've given much thought to the fact that I ought to
Have more control over my life
How can I fight it, how can I deny it,
There's no way to hide it
The love that I have for my wife.

We lived in a oneroom rundown shack on the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent to say the least we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had to buy me a satin dancin' dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair and she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into my satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hips
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good and starin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck and she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes when she started to speak
She looked at a pitful shack and then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
Your pa's run off and I'm real sick and the baby's gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said to thine owenself be true
And I shivered as I watched a rouch crawl across the toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin' askin' mama what do I do
Just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy and they'll be nice to you
Here's your one chance...

Lord forgive me for what I do but if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown

But the wheels of fate had started to turn and for me there was no way out

I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That I was gonna be a lady someday though I didn't know when or how

There was happiness written in the smile on his face
But I couldn't see hers neath the veil of white lace

I pitied that stranger for all he could see
Was their life together till eternity
My heart filled with anger when I pictured the face
Of a false hearted quitter neath a veil of white lace

I reached in my pocket when the wedding was done
My hand touched a locket then fell on a gun
It shattered the silence as it left its trace
Stains of red crimson on a veil of white lace

I ran from the church house as I threw down the gun
But stopped on the door step for there crossing the lawn
My darling said she had decided she'd wait
Death to a stranger neath a veil of white lace

And every time I slip and fall you're still there to care

Let's call all mistakes we've made learning learning
Reach out together and the love light's still burning

But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together

Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times

I'll get along you'll find another and I'll be here if you should find you ever need me

Not overly concerned with life and love
I was always feelin' sorry for myself and my bad luck
I never stopped to think what life's made of
With my nose to the grindstone and my shoulder to the wheel
I fought for my daily dollar like a man
Then you came into my life and nothing else seemed real
I found the answer right here in my hands
Now I've got everything a man could ever need
I've got dreams to dream and songs to sing in the morning
I've got hands to hold my baby child and eyes to wach my woman smile
I've got everything a man could ever need

Now my working day seems shorter than it ever did before
And the evening breeze gets cooler day by day
And the morning sun is always shinin' down on my back door
And your laughter washes all my cares away
There's not a day goes by that I don't look up to the skies
And humbly thank the good Lord up above
For bringing you to me in time to make me realize
That all a poor man really needs is love
