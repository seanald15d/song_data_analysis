0,1,Mary MacGregor,"There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules

5,6,Johnny Cash,"Well I left Kentucky back in '49 and
Went to Detroit workin' on the assembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it outta there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least 100 grand

I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out my buddy's mobile home
Now up to now my plan went all right
Till we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that somethin' was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53 and
The motor turned out to be a '73 and
When we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit and
With a little bit of help from an adapter kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all 3 of 'em come on
The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well that's when we noticed that we only had one tail fin
About that time my wife walked out and
I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said
""Honey, take me for a spin""
So we drove uptown just to get the tags and
I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff and
When they got through the title weighed 60 pounds

I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild

7,8,Red Sovine,"I was on the outskirts of a little southern town
Trying to reach my destination before the sun went down
The old CB was blarin' away on Channel 1-9
When there came a little boy's voice on the radio line
And he said, ""Breaker 1-9 is anyone there?
Come on back truckers and talk to Teddy Bear.""
I keyed the mike and I said, ""You got it, Teddy Bear.""
And the little boy's voice came back on the air
""Appreciate the breaker who we got on that end?""
I told him my handle and then he began:

""Though I'm not supposed to bother you fellows out there
Mom says you're busy and for me to stay off the air
But you see I get lonely and it helps to talk
Cause that's about all I can do I'm crippled and I can't walk.""
I came back and told him to fire up that mike
And I'd talk to him as long as he'd liked.

""This was my dad's radio"", the little boy said
""But I guess it's mine and mom's now cause my daddy's dead.
Dad had a wreck about a month ago
He was tryin' to get home in a blinding snow.
Mom has to work now to make ends meet
And I'm not much help with my two crippled feet.
She says not to worry that we'll make it all right,
But I hear her cryin' sometimes late at night.
You know there's one thing I want more than anything else to see.
Oh I know you guys are too busy to bother with me,
But you see my dad used to take me for rides when he was home.
But I guess that's all over now since my daddy's gone.""

Not one breaker came on the old CB as that little crippled boy talked with me
I tried hard to swallow a lump just wouldn't stay down
As I thought about my boy back in Greenville town.

""Dad was gonna take mom and me with him later on this year
Why I remember him sayin' 'Someday
This old truck will be yours, Teddy Bear.'
But I know now I'll never get a ride on 18-wheeler again
But this old base'll keep me in touch with all my trucker friends
Teddy Bear's gonna back on out now and leave you alone
'Cause it's about time for mom to come home
But you give me shout when you're passin' through
And I'll surely be happy to come back to you.""

Well I came back and I said, ""Before you go 10-10
What's your home 20 little CB friend?""
He gave me his address and I didn't once hesitate
Cause this hot load of freight would just have to wait.
I turned that truck around on a dime
And headed straight for Jackson Street 229
And as I rounded the corner, oh I got one the heck of a shock
18-wheelers were lined up for three city blocks
I guess every driver for miles around had caught Teddy Bear's call
And that little crippled boy was havin' a ball.
For as fast as one driver would carry him in
Another would carry him to his truck and take off again
Well you better believe I took my turn ridin' Teddy Bear,
And then carried him back in and put him down in his chair
And buddy if I never live to see happiness again
I want you to know I saw it that day in the face of that little man.
We took up a collection for him before his mama got home
And each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone

He shook my hand with a mile long grin and said, ""So long trucker. I'll catch you again.""
Ah I hit that Interstate with tears in my eyes
I turned on the radio and I got another surprise
Breaker 1-9 came the voice on the air
""Just one word of thanks from mama Teddy Bear.
We wish each and everyone a special prayer for you,
Cause you just made my little boy's dream come true.
I'll sign off now, before I start to cry. May God ride with you. 10-4 and goodbye.""",Teddy Bear,Teddy Bear ,1976,2,5:03,Track 'A',Single,True
8,9,Tom T. Hall,"He was an old-time cowboy, don't you understand 
His eyes were sharp as razor blades 
His face was leather tan 
His toes were pointed inward from a-hangin' on a horse 
He was an old philosopher, of course
He was so thin I swear you could have used him for a whip 
He had to drink a beer to keep his britches on his hips 
I knew I had to ask him about the mysteries of life
He spit between his boots and he replied,

""Son, it's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, more money.""

He smiled and all his teeth were covered with tobacco stains 
He said, ""It don't do men no good to pray for peace and rain. 
Peace and rain is just a way to say prosperity, 
And buffalo chips is all it means to me.""

I told him I was a poet, I was lookin' for the truth 
I do not care for horses, whiskey, women or the loot 
I said I was a writer, my soul was all on fire 
He looked at me an' he said, ""You are a liar.""

""Son, it's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, more money.""

Well, I was disillusioned, if I say the least 
I grabbed him by the collar and I jerked him to his feet 
There was something cold and shiny layin' by my head 
So I started to believe the things he said

Well, my poet days are over and I'm back to being me 
As I enjoy the peace and comfort of reality
If my boy ever asks me what it is that I have learned 
I think that I will readily affirm

25,26,Marty Robbins,"From thirty thousand feet above
The desert floor, I see it there below
A city with a legend -
The west Texas city of El Paso
Where long ago I heard a song
About a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's
Where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl.

I don't recall who sang the song
But I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city,
I remember each and ev'ry word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy
And the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy
Then he had to leave El Paso on the run.

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
The cowboy lived and rode away
But love was strong he couldn't stay
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
I try not to let you cross my mind
But still I find there's just a mystery
In the song that I don't understand.

My mind is down there somewhere
As I fly above the badlands of New Mexico
I can't explain why I should know
The very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear
From life and live another time
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think
That you yourself lived in that other time.

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts
Familar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions
That I've had so long but I have never told
Like every time I fly up through the heavens
And I see you there below
I get the feeling sometime
In another world I lived in El Paso.

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
Could it be that I could be
The cowboy in this mystery
That died there in that desert sand so long ago
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
A voice tells me to go and see
Another voice keeps tellin' me
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso",El Paso City,El Paso City,1976,10,4:13,Track 'A1',Album,True

I sure need to talk to you
If you can only spare the time.
And Mom I hope you understand
How much I love and need you

Came by today to see me

With him and Billy on a hike

And maybe if I ask him to
He'd sit and talk with me man to man
We'd only be gone overnight
And I could find out what it's like

He'd never really known his dad
And although he'd never ask
She knew exactly what was on his mind
She searched her mind in desperation,
Six long years of separation
Dimmed the words she knew she had to say

Or old enough or bold enough

71,72,Jimmy Dean,"You know most people look through their wallets or their pocketbooks
And way down at the bottom Past the credit cards and baby pictures, greenstamps, you usually find a little old dog eared piece poetry.

I was cleaning out my wallet the other day and I ran across a whole bunch of I.O.U.'s some of them thirty years overdue. Funny thing is that all these I.O.U.'s are owed to one person, and I kinda feel like right now might be a pretty good time for an accounting.

Mom, you listenin?

Mom, I owe you for so many things, a lot of services, like night watchman for instance, for lying awake nights listening for coughs, cries, creaking floorboards and me coming in too late. You had the eye of an eagle, the roar of a lion, but you always had a heart as big as a house.

I owe you for services as a short order cook, chef, baker, for making sirloin out of hamburger, turkey out of tuna fish and two big ol' strapping boys out of leftovers.

I owe you for cleaning services, for the daily scrubbing of face and ears all work done by hand and for the frequent dusting of a small boys pants to try to make sure that he led a spotless life and for washing and ironing, no laundry could ever do. For drying the tears of childhood and for Ironing out the problems of growing up.

I owe you for servics as a bodyguard, for protecting me from the terrors of thunderstorms and nightmares ha, and too many green apples.

And Lord knows I owe you for medical attention, for nursing me through measles, mumps, bruises, bumps, splinters and spring fever.
And let's not forget medical advise either, Oh, no.
Important things like ha ha, don't scratching it or it won't get well,
If you cross your eyes they're gonna stick like that And probably ah, most Important of all was, be sure you got on clean underwear boy, in case you're in an accident.

And I owe you for veterinarian services, for feeding every lost dog that I dragged home at the end of the rope and for healing the pains of puppy love.

And I owe you for entertainment, entertainment that kept the household going during some pretty tough times, for wonderful productions at Christmas, 4th of July and birthdays, and for making make believe come true on a very limited budget.

I owe you for construction work, for building kites, confidence, hopes and dreams and somehow you made 'em all touch the sky.

And for cementing a family together so it would stand the worst kinds of shocks and blows and for laying down a good strong foundation to build a life on.

I owe you for carrying charges, for carrying me on your books for the necessities of life that a growing boy just gotta have. Things like, a oh, a pair of high top boots with a little pocket on the side for a jackknife.

And one thing, Mom, I will never ever forget when there were two pieces of apple pie left and three hungry people I noticed that you were the one who suddenly decided that you really didn't like apple pie in the 1st place.

These are just a very few of the things for which payment is long overdue, the person I owe 'em to worked very cheap.
She managed by simply doing without a whole lotta things that she needed herself.

My I.O.U.'s add up to much more than I could ever hope to repay.
But you know the nicest thing about it all is that, I know that she'll mark the entire bill paid in full for just one kiss and four little words.

There lived a beautiful Mexican girl named Ava Maria Morales
Her dark hair would glisten and shine when touched by the sun
And she loved a cowboy that told her he worked
ON a ranch just outside of Tucson

Diamonds he gave to her caused many people to say
How could he give her such diamonds as these on thirty a month cowboy pay
She paid no attention to what they said or what they did
'Cause she never doubted he worked on a ranch
Out of Tucson, just like he said

Then to Nogalas, one mormin', came ridin' a stranger
He wore a badge on the front of his vest, the new one in town was a Ranger
And he showed some pictures of outlaws and bandits he chased
And one of the pictures caused Ava Maria
To turn with fear on her face

Ava Maria
It's true what they said
Your cowboy's an outlaw
With a price on his head

The Ranger left town on the trail of the outlaws he hunted
Ava Maria prayed he'd never catch the cowboy she loved and she wanted
'Cause deep in her heart she believed that the Ranger was wrong
The outlaw just looked like the cowboy that worked
On the ranch just outside of Tucson

True love would never let Ava Maria believe it
And there in her window each evenin' she'd light
A candle and hoped he would see it
The years turned her dark hair to silver but love still lived on
She prayed every night for the cowboy that worked
On the ranch just outside of Tucson

One night the town of Nogalas was saddened to see
The window where Ava Maria would watch was dark where a light used to be

One of the bravest by far
It's said that old Bill was the fastest man ever
To pin on a ranger's star
Stories about him were legends
Bill was the best of the bold
Bad men all feared him way back in his day
But he was now growing old 

Into Bill's town rode an outlaw
He wore his gun low and tied down
He reined in his horse and announced to the crowd
""If you speak to me call me Sundown""
His clothes were all dark and fancy
And topped by a black leather vest
Somebody asked how he came by his name
And if he was one of the best.

The eyes of the tall stranger narrowed
He grinned like the devil possessed
""I never fight till the sun's going down
And my back is facing the West"" 

Said he wouldn't be with us tomorrow
He only rode in for one thing
He only stopped by to make Bill Thaxton die
So he could add to his fame.
""Go give Bill Thaxton a message
And tell him a killer's in town
Tell him we'll meet at the end of the street
Just as the sun's going down"" 

Somebody said it had been years
Since old Bill had toted a gun
Sundown replied that it wasn't his hide
Killing old Bill would be fun
The old ranger sent back his answer
""Tell him that I'm on my way
I've never ran and I'll meet this young man
At any time of the day""

Bill got there just about sunset
It still hung like fire in the sky
In just a few moments out there in the street
Old Bill or the outlaw would die 

Slowly Bill slid from the saddle
And started to make his advance
The sun hit the old ranger square in the eyes
The shadows had started to dance
Bill started talking to Sundown
Judging his distance that way
Their stride was the same and at just thirty feet
Both of the men made their play 

Bill's gun slipped leather like lightning
His forty-four spoke with a whine
The sun didn't bother Bill Thaxton at all
Because the old ranger was blind
Six shots delivered their message
The ranger had emptied his gun
Bill gave a sigh when there was no reply
He knew that once more he had won 

The old ranger lowered his six gun
He just stood there starting ahead
Watching you'd think that old Bill didn't know
In front of him Sundown lay dead

And both of us were lonely
We seemed to meet as lonely people do
I filled that empty space till Monday morning

I never meant ton fall in love with you
Came right out and told me
About your wife back home in Houston
You were just in town on business
You never tried to lead me on

Time had seemed just fine
Simply love you for the moment
Heaven help me, time ran out
Now the moment's gone

Silver wings and golden rings
Are taking you today
And I'll be dying on the ground
While you are flying away

Silver wings and golden rings
Are shinning on and on
While the only love
I've ever known is gone

You made me feel like
I was something special
The way no other man ever done
And I knew last night
Would have to last forever

It's just no way of holding back the sun
And now I guess it's time for me
To drive you to the airport
Hold back all my tears
Tell you it's been nice

If you come back to town again
Know I love to see you
Remember I'm not strong enough
To let go of you twice

Are taking you today
And I'll be dying on the ground

344,N/A,Jimmy Dean,"You know most people look through their wallets or their pocketbooks
And way down at the bottom Past the credit cards and baby pictures, greenstamps, you usually find a little old dog eared piece poetry.

I was cleaning out my wallet the other day and I ran across a whole bunch of I.O.U.'s some of them thirty years overdue. Funny thing is that all these I.O.U.'s are owed to one person, and I kinda feel like right now might be a pretty good time for an accounting.

Mom, you listenin?

Mom, I owe you for so many things, a lot of services, like night watchman for instance, for lying awake nights listening for coughs, cries, creaking floorboards and me coming in too late. You had the eye of an eagle, the roar of a lion, but you always had a heart as big as a house.

I owe you for services as a short order cook, chef, baker, for making sirloin out of hamburger, turkey out of tuna fish and two big ol' strapping boys out of leftovers.

I owe you for cleaning services, for the daily scrubbing of face and ears all work done by hand and for the frequent dusting of a small boys pants to try to make sure that he led a spotless life and for washing and ironing, no laundry could ever do. For drying the tears of childhood and for Ironing out the problems of growing up.

I owe you for servics as a bodyguard, for protecting me from the terrors of thunderstorms and nightmares ha, and too many green apples.

And Lord knows I owe you for medical attention, for nursing me through measles, mumps, bruises, bumps, splinters and spring fever.
And let's not forget medical advise either, Oh, no.
Important things like ha ha, don't scratching it or it won't get well,
If you cross your eyes they're gonna stick like that And probably ah, most Important of all was, be sure you got on clean underwear boy, in case you're in an accident.

And I owe you for veterinarian services, for feeding every lost dog that I dragged home at the end of the rope and for healing the pains of puppy love.

And I owe you for entertainment, entertainment that kept the household going during some pretty tough times, for wonderful productions at Christmas, 4th of July and birthdays, and for making make believe come true on a very limited budget.

I owe you for construction work, for building kites, confidence, hopes and dreams and somehow you made 'em all touch the sky.

And for cementing a family together so it would stand the worst kinds of shocks and blows and for laying down a good strong foundation to build a life on.

I owe you for carrying charges, for carrying me on your books for the necessities of life that a growing boy just gotta have. Things like, a oh, a pair of high top boots with a little pocket on the side for a jackknife.

And one thing, Mom, I will never ever forget when there were two pieces of apple pie left and three hungry people I noticed that you were the one who suddenly decided that you really didn't like apple pie in the 1st place.

These are just a very few of the things for which payment is long overdue, the person I owe 'em to worked very cheap.
She managed by simply doing without a whole lotta things that she needed herself.

My I.O.U.'s add up to much more than I could ever hope to repay.
But you know the nicest thing about it all is that, I know that she'll mark the entire bill paid in full for just one kiss and four little words.

Just a little touch and he was on the way

Instead I died there

I can see the way you feel
I just know without you saying
What is a lie and what's real

So am I, I'm living alone now
I was wrong, so were you

Are you glad to be free

And it might help you too

Moved aside and left a space for me now 
Wasted, wasted love walled up inside you

Tears and memories all cried away

Lonely and hiding the light from their eyes
Still too afraid to light up the night 
Too lonely to come out of hiding

Well I've seen you with the young girls
They come when you call
They make love so easy 
They don't love at all
You want me to come running 
When your world's falling in
You want me till you got me 
Then you're gone again

And your passion comes so easy
Then you ease away from me

Cause the last time you loved was the first time you ever cried
It was the first time you ever really loved
It's the last time you ever tried

Your defenses become you, now you become them
It's one night on the weekend
Then you're gone again
Well I'm tears and I'm passion and there's a woman in me
Stop all your runnin' and I'll set you free

And I stand before you naked, and my soul is on my sleeve
