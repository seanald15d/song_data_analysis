0,1,Alabama,"Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on the state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die

Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in a rat race
And these days that's a special way of life

Down Home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down Home
A man's good word and a hand shake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times they can fall back home
Those of us raised up down home

In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered round on a checkered board
Old men telling lies and crownin' kings

Kids drivin' round the old town square
Cops roll down int he cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen

1,2,Garth Brooks,"Just the other night
At a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into
My old highschool flame
And as I introduced them
The past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of
The way things used to be

She was the one
That I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin'
That God would make her mine
And if He'd only granted me
This wish I'd wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God
For unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin'
To the man upstairs
That just because He doesn't answer
Doesn't mean He don't care!
Some of God's greatest gifts are
Unanswered prayers...!

She wasn't quite the angel
That I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me,
And her eyes too, it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows
What He's doing after all

And as she walked away
Well I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God
For unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin'
To the man upstairs
And just because He may not answer
Doesn't mean He don't care!

And I've made myself a world, and it's worked so perfectly,
But it's your world now, I can't refuse,
I've never had so much to lose.

To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong.

Splashing through the mud and the muck

Are you sure that I'm ready to drive this car now
He said, I'm right here beside you, and you're gonna do fine

So, keep your hands on the wheel, believe in the things that are real
Just take your time, and keep it between the lines

Lying on the floor with his coloring book
Then he caught me watching, and he climbed on my knee
He said, daddy, oh daddy, would you do one with me

Then I hugged him so tightly as we turned the page
Said, I haven't done this since I was your age
He said, I'm right here beside you, and you're gonna do fine
Daddy, all you gotta do is keep it between the lines

So we finished the picture, and I put him to bed
Got down on my knees and I bowed my head
And I said, father, oh father, I feel so alone
Are you sure I can raise him with his mommy gone

Then the answer came back so gentle and low
And words of my daddy from so long ago
Said, I'm right here beside you, and you're gonna do fine

One last goodbye and you drove away

So I laid down on the couch instead

Last night I prayed the Lord, my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep
So sure life wouldn't go on without you

But, oh, this Sun is blinding me
As it wakes me from the dark

I guess the world didn't stop
For my broken heart

Clocks still tickin', life goes on
Radio still plays a song
As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place

And it takes all the strength I've got
To stumble to the coffee pot
The first of many lonely mornings I have to face

You call to see if I'm okay

I brought her home from the movies, you stayed up late
Three on the couch watchin' TV
I was smilin' at her while you were laughin' at me

But, I wouldn't trade it for nothin'
Brotherly love

There's a bond that brothers know
And it gets stronger as they grow
A love that time and miles can't come between
We disagree but in the end
There will never be two closer friends
And brotherly love is something we all need

They share the same last name and the same color eyes
But they fight like tigers over one old red bike
And lookin' at them reminds me of us
They're gonna fight and they're gonna fuss

But, they've got something special
It's brotherly love

Yeah, they've got something special
It's brotherly love",Brotherly Love,Backbone Job / Brotherly Love,1991,2,3:17,Track 'B',Single,True

Find a two-step partner and a Cajun beat

Out in the middle of a big dance floor

Gonna dance to a band from a-Lou'sian' tonight

Well I never have wandered down to New Orleans
Never have drifted down a bayou stream
But I heard that music on the radio
And I swore some day I was gonna go
Down Highway 10 past Lafayette
To Baton Rouge and I won't forget
To send you a card with my regrets

Lying all alone in this midnight blue
With nothing but these memories of you
Staring at these walls that are closing in
Wondering if you're ever coming back again.

Now I'm just a prisoner in this big old bed
Living with the things that I should've said
Why is it always after someone's gone
That you begin to see where you went wrong.

I couldn't see you leaving, but I can see you're gone
That note you left on my pillow said I was on my own
I never heard you crying, 'cause I was seldom home
I couldn't see you leaving, but I can see you're gone.

I just keep wondering where you are tonight
And if someone else is holding you tight
It took you walking out the door to see
That I'm really nothing when you're not with me.

I did a good job of fooling myself
Thinking that you're love would stay on the shelf
But how could anybody be so blind
To have to wake up alone and find.

When you have to stand up straight and tall and mean the word you say.
There is a point you must decide just to do it 'cause it's right.
That's when you become a point of light.

There is a darkness that everyone must face.
It wants to take what's good and fair and lay it all to waste.
And that darkness covers everything in sight
Until it meets a single point of light.

All it takes is a point of light,
A ray of hope in the darkest night.
If you see what's wrong and you try to make it right,
You will be a point of light.

There are heroes whose names we never hear,
A dedicated army of quiet volunteers
Reaching out to feed the hungry,
Reaching out to save the land,
Reaching out to help their fellow man.

There are dreamers who are making dreams come true,
Taking time to to teach the children
There's nothing they can't do,
Giving shelter to the homeless,
Giving hope to those without.
Isn't that what this land's all about?

One by one, from the mountains to the sea
Points of light are calling out to you and me.

91,92,Reba McEntire,"I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""
She said just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy
Don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now, don't let me down, now,
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown""

Well, that was the last time I saw my Mama
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
Wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do
And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down""

It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman,
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ears

She said, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you

Drinking some and gambling
And tieing up loose ends.

My congratulations

But I can't find a place I can hide
And that old lonesome dove is gonna mournfor his love
No matter how far he flies.

When he fell in love himself he came to understand
How it was that bobby took the life they both adored
Cause bobby couldn't stand to see her suffer anymore
He took out the papers from the trunk beneath his bed
And all the years just disappeared as through his tears he read
The stories of the accident that robbed his mama's mind
And the man who held her in his arms and chose to cut the line
And the one about the man who sits alone

They lead him to a cold grey room, the guard told him to wait

He took bobby in his arms, and the young man sang the song

And it's not every night a comet comes around

It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""
She said just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down

But if you want out well it's up to you
Now, don't let me down, now,

Well, that was the last time I saw my Mama
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
Wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do
And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down""

It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman,
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
I ain't done bad

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out

Opened his case and started a tune

But when I can't explain to him the tears that fill my eyes
He takes me in his arms and rocks his melancholy child

A Southern sense of humor and you got someone like me

You tried to tell me that it just wouldn't work
Your heart was too far gone
And it might have been easier to leave you alone

I've seen enough to know, a heart worth savin'
Enough to know, a chance worth takin'
Even though you're tryin' not to let it show
There's a part of you that's dyin', dyin' to let go
I've seen enough to know,
I've seen enough to know

There's a light in your eyes and a warmth to your touch
That wasn't there yesterday
And there's a crack in the wall
That you've built around your heart
And it's startin' to give way
It's taken time, it's taken patience waiting in the dark
But my intuition's been right on the money so far

I've seen enough to know, a chance worth takin'
Enough to know, a heart worth savin'
Even though you're tryin' not to let it show
There's a part of you that's dyin', dyin' to let go
I've seen enough to know,
I've seen enough to know

Now there's signs of life and there's signs of hope
Signs of a real love starting to grow

Even though you're tryin' not to let it show
There's a part of you that's dyin', dyin' to let go
I've seen enough to know,
I've seen enough to know
You know it's startin' to show,
I've seen enough to know",I've Seen Enough To Know,Put Yourself In My Place,1991,10,,Track '9',Album,False
478,N/A,Pam Tillis,"You come banging on the screen door
Begging me to let you in
All I got to say is, ""Honey, where you been?""
This time I think it's you that's surrenderin'

You see I've already fallen
Yeah, I've already fallen
If you're waiting on me you're backing up
I'm way in over my head in love
It's true
Well, I've aleady fallen for you

Well you look so serious leaning on the Frigidaire
And, gee, it's sweet of you to ask me if I really care
Honey, I'm already picking out the silverware.

You see I've already fallen
Yeah, I've already fallen
If you're waiting on me you're backing up
I'm way in over my head in love
It's true
Well, I've aleady fallen for you

I must have played this scene out a hundred times in my head
That you'd look me in the eyes and say
You love me like you just did
But you'd better tell me twice
'Cause I'm still one step ahead

You see I've already fallen
Yeah, I've already fallen
If you're waiting on me you're backing up
I'm way in over my head in love
It's true
Well, I've aleady fallen for you
Yeah, I've already fallen for you",Already Fallen,Put Yourself In My Place,1991,10,,Track '10',Album,False
479,N/A,Dwight Yoakam,"Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again  (Hey girl)
I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin' again

Well I know that the neighbours are all a-talkin'
They swear that I have lost my mind
Ah but they do not know
That I've just gained control
Of all the heartache that you left behind

Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again  (Ah girl)
Well I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
Since I started drinkin' again

Well I know that the boss is a-gonna fire me
When I stumble in late to work again
Ah but surprise will replace that old scowl on his face
When he sees that I do not give a damn

Since I started drinkin' again
Since I started drinkin' again  (Hey girl)
Well I ain't shed one lousy tear over you
