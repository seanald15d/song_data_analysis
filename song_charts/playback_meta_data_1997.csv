Middle of the night
Takin' your heart
And holdin' it tight

Emotional touch
Touchin' my skin
And askin' you to do
What you've been doin' all over again

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

It's your love
It just does somethin' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell I'm under
It's your love

Better than I was
More than I am
And all of this happened
By takin' your hand

And who I am now
Is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together
I'm stronger than ever
I'm happy and free

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in, no

All I gotta do is say your sweet name

1,2,Shania Twain,"Life was going great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry, had no worries
Staying single was the plan
Didn't need a steady man
I had it covered, 'til I discovered

That love gets me every time

And I gol' darn gone and done it, hoo

Gone and done it (gone and done it)
I guess I fell in love (gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (gone and done it)
Or his sweet, sweet talk (gone and done it)

Songs that we had never heard
But we danced anyway
We never understood the words
We just sang oh la la la la la la la la

But baby I don't believe that
Come along with me, come on and dance with me

You'll never leave the ground,""

She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

You are the love of my life

Till you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know is I need you

And you are the love of my life

In Carolina barefoot on the beaches

And I hear you're doin' fine
Livin' out by the county line
Got a man that's home every night
A couple of kids, and the kind of life
That you want to lead
Guess you could say the same for me
But you and I made our choices
All those years ago
Still I know I'll hear your voice
And see you down the road

Maybe in
Oklahoma drivin' cross the prairie
In Dallas, Texas, isn't that where we
Always said we would like to try
Never did, so maybe that's why

Right beside me in all of my sweet dreams

Get scattered by the wind
Tossed upon the waves
Lost for years on end
Friends
Slowly drift apart
They give away their hearts
Maybe call you
Now and Then
But you wanna be
Just friends

You say you love me very much
And you'll always hold me dear
Those are the sweetest words
I never want to hear
What's a love without desire
A flame without a fire
Can't warm me late at night
When I need you most

Get scattered by the wind
Tossed upon the waves
Lost for years on end
Friends
Slowly drift apart
They give away their hearts
Maybe call you
Now and Then
But you wanna be
Just friends

They give away their hearts
Maybe call you now and then

Is she happy with her choice
Or is that a tear I hear in her voice

I thought boy she's got some nerve

I heard more then just her words

I finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you

My halo disappears without a trace I swear

But I don't care

But heaven help me honey I ain't changing my ways

Up in the twilight sky.

She's a good ways gone, but I'm closin' the gap,

On the inside of a matchbook that was laying on the bar
And a fire started burning somewhere in my heart

I just never thought you'd leave me after all this time.
But today when I came home my key was hollow in the door
And there was nothing but a worn out book of matches on the floor

You took the bed; you took the dishes and the car
And you broke my trust and you took advantage of my heart
And you left me here with empty rooms and walls with holes, scars and scratches,
If I find the strength to burn your memory down
At least you left the matches.

The color is old and faded; the cover's worn and stained
I can still make out the numbers and the heart beside your name
Until tonight they'd only lit a single cigarette
Now one by one I'm striking them to help me to forget

And everybody at the broken spoke
They all thought my crazy story was a joke
Now they're all out in the parking lot
Staring at the smoke

It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""
She said just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy
Don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now, don't let me down, now,

Well, that was the last time I saw my Mama
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
Wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do
And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy,

Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pourin' his tea

I charmed a king, a congressman,
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat

Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous
Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out

We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgoten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a 75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel

My Uncle bought new in 64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thickpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedels
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door

I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right

Your doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti

I'm grown up now
3 daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet

I can't replace the way it made me feel

Turn it left, and steer it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine

I picked her up at work Tuesday afternoon
That night we were rocking the town
Wednesday, Thursday, Time sure flies
When you're having a ball
A perfect match, no strings attached

Set off a chain reaction like I'd never seen
I was shakin' in my boots
When she lit the fuse I was blown to smithereens

And the thanks he'd get for helpin' them
Would make him wish he was bustin' broncs again

It was just a simple robbery turned double homicide
And they got away with murder it'd be someone else's hide

Till they found one of our vagabonds already doing time
And when that jailbird started singing
They know all the words were wrong
But the sheriff and the D.A. and the judge all sang along
They pinned it on Jack Favor, gave him life without parole
Gave Jack's freedom to the jailbird, payment on the lies he told
And it just so happens that election year
Everybody made out at the polls

Look at the sky
Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me
The heavens are sparkling
With starlight tonight
That's what I see
Through your eyes

I see the heavens
Each time that you smile
I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see
Through your eyes

Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop what we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes

I look at myself
And instead I see us
Whoever I am now
It feels like enough
And I see a girl
Who is learning to trust
That's who I see through your eyes

And there are some things we don't know
Sometimes a heart just needs to go
And there is so much THAT I'll remember
Underneath the open sky with you forever

And Rachel was a land baron's daughter
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth
Her daddy said he wouldn't stand
For Rachel to waste her life with a common man
He tried hard to keep them apart
But you can't draw lines in a young girl's heart

So late one night by the harvest moon
Jacob climbed a ladder up to Rachel's room
He knew his place, it was right beside her
Step by step up to her world
Head over heels for a brown-eyed girl
And gettin' caught didn't seem to matter
'Cause heaven was waitin' at the top of Jacob's ladder

It'll be five years September
Since her daddy found the ladder and a note on her windowsill
He swore he'd never forgive them
But nothin' melts a heart like a grandchild will
Now she climbs up on his knee
Says, ""Grandpa tell a story, the one about me""
He thinks back and his eyes shine
Says, ""Listen child, once upon a time""

I'm not much on hangin' around
Where I'm not wanted at all
I'm not gonna be your love sick clown
Waitin' for your beck and call

I'm gonna get a life
That's what I'm gonna do
So startin' now
You can find one too
I'm gonna get a life
Like I should have done
A long time ago
Before you wrecked this one

This'll be the last time you spin your wheels
Leaving like a maniac
You don't care about the way I feel
There's no need in comin' back

I'm gonna get a life
That's what I'm gonna do
So startin' now
You can find one too
I'm gonna get a life
Like I should have done
A long time ago
Before you wrecked this one
Yeah, I'm gonna get a life
Before the gettin's done

I'm gonna get a life
That's what I'm gonna do
So startin' now
You can find one too
I'm gonna get a life
Like I should have done
A long time ago
Before you wrecked this one

789,N/A,Mark Chesnutt,"With the alarm clock ting-a-ling ringin' in my head 
I woke up dog tired, beat down, half dead 
Tryin' to recover from another wild weekend 
Chuggin' down coffee while I should have been sleepin'  

Well it sure is Monday idn't it now 
I gotta myself through the week somehow 
I had a ball Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
But it's all over now and it sure is Monday  

Oh, I got to the job site at a quarter past nine 
And somehow I stayed awake till lunch time 
And then I caught a little nap, stretched out in my truck bed 
My feet still twitchin' to the music in my head  

Well it sure is Monday, ain't it the truth 
I partied too hardy, now I'm payin' my dues 
I had a ball Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
But it's all over now and it sure is Monday  

Well it sure is Monday, ain't it a sin 
I gotta work my way through the week again 
I had a ball Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
But it's all over now and it sure is Monday 
Yeah, it's all over now and it sure is Monday.",It Sure Is Monday,Greatest Hits,1996,12,3:01,Track '10',Compilation,False
790,N/A,Mark Chesnutt,"Six short months we went together
Decided it should be forever
Two paychecks are better than one
A diamond ring and it was done
Bought her a house like I said I would
In sub-divided neighborhood
The fuse got short and the nights got long
It was over long gone
Before I knew
Where I was headed to

I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the palace
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas

Things like this are never final
I'm still payin' on the vinyl
Flooring in the laundry room
It's multi-colored and waterproof
It's a little bit tough to face my friends

The ones that said I jumped in
The river of love a little too soon
That was August
This is June and it's a different tune

I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the palace
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas

I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas
I can't believe what the judge had to tell us
I got the Jeep she got the two bedroom 
Mortgage is due
Siding light blue palace
I'm goin' through the big D
And don't mean Dallas

791,N/A,Mark Chesnutt,"I don't know how I'll get her off my mind, but give me time
I'll think of somethin'
I can't say that I'm all right, but by tonight
I'll think of somethin'

I'll find so many things to do that I won't have the time to think of her
And then if she's still on my mind I'll try to drink enough to drown the hurt
And if that don't work
I'll think of somethin'

Where do I go for love that I still need, now that I'm free
I'll think of something
And if someday by accident we meet, and I can't speak
Well I'll think of somethin'

If I can't say a word to her I'll blame it on this lump that's in my throat
And standin' there what will I do to hide my love enough that it won't show
Oh I don't know
But I'll think of somethin'
I don't know

I don't know how I'll get her off my mind, but give me time
And I'll think of somethin'",I'll Think Of Something,Greatest Hits,1996,12,2:34,Track '12',Compilation,False
