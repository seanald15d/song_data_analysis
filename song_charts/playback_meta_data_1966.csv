0,1,Jack Greene,"There goes my only possession there goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possession there goes my everything

As my mem'ry turns back the pages I can see the happy years we had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of a door
There goes my reason for living...",There Goes My Everything,There Goes My Everything,1966,2,2:33,Track 'A',Single,True
1,2,David Houston,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man.

Then she came and sat down at my table
As she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine.

And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you,
Take me away from here and be my man.""

Then I looked into her eyes and saw it
The reflection of my wedding band
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.",Almost Persuaded,Almost Persuaded,1966,10,2:55,Track 'A1',Album,True

I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the Heartbreak Hotel

9,10,Red Sovine,"The highways that wind and wander over mountain and valleys deserts and plains
I guess I've drove about all of 'em
Cause for the past 25 years now the cab of a truck has been my home
And it'd be kinda hard for me to settle down and not be on the go
Why I remember the first truck I drove
I was so proud I could hardly wait to get home to show my wife and my little boy
And my little boy was so excited like so when he saw his first snow
He wasn't old enough to say too many words
He just kept hollering goddyup go daddy giddyup go
So that's what I named the old truck Giddyup go
Oh things wasn't too bad of course I's gone a lot
And after about six years I got home one day and found my wife and little boy gone
I couldn't find out what happened nobody seemed to know
So from that day on it's been me and old Giddyup go
I've made a lot of friends at all the truck stops
And some of 'em would kick me about my litle sign
Of course they knew where I got the name
'Cause I told 'em about that little boy of mine
And how his first word about that old truck was Giddyup go
Today I was barrelin' down old 66
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me a big lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cold
A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddyup go
Well I pushed old Giddyup go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen and I lost all track of pop
Mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on old 66 and he's handled that big rig
Better than any gearjammer that I'd ever seen
Well now the lines on the highway have got much brighter glow

16,17,Johnny Cash,"There once was a musical troupe 
A pickin' singin' folk group
They sang the mountain ballads 
And the folk songs of our land

They were long on musical ability 
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads 
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity 
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended 
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered to hear The folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously 
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously 
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear, said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction 
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions keep them to yourself

And the one in the middle drives a truck

Out on runway No 9 big 7-0-7 set to go
But I'm standin' on the grass where the cold winds blow
Where the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes my friend she's a rolling now at last
Hear the mighty engines roar see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shine
She'll be flying o'er my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground as cold and drunk as I can be

In that crazy place called Washington DC
I saw a crowd of people on the White House lawn all carrying signes about VietNam
So I went over to see what was goin' on
It was a strange looking bunch but then I never could understand some people
Oh a fellow came to me with a list in his hand he said we're gatherin' names to send
The telegram of sympathy then he handed me a pen
I said I reckon this is goin' to kids and wives
My friends over there who're givin' their lives
He said ah ah buddy this is goin' to Ho-Chi-Min
I said Ho-Chi who he said Ho-Chi-Min people's leader North VietNam
Oh I wasn't really sure I was hearin' him right
I though I'd better move before I got in a fight
Cause my ears were hurtin' and my ball started hit my lick
Then I thought of another telegram that I've just read
Tellin' my buddy's wife that her husband was dead
It wasn't too long till I was feelin' downright sick
Another held the sign that said we won't fight
I thought to myself boy ain't that right
To leave a lot of our soldiers die instead
I said it's a shame that every man who ever died up there that far off land
Was dyin' for that you wouldn't have to wake up dead
Course he looked at me like I was kinda crazy just another warmonger
Oh I left that place and I went downtown and hit first bar that I'd found
To cool myself off and pacify my brain

One night down in New Orleans
Up above the bar hung a big guitar
Like none I'd ever seen.

The neck was set with diamonds
And though the strings were old
Like Kings of sound they wound around
Six keys of solid gold.

A man stepped up beside me
His breath was strong with wine
He said you know that guitar once belonged
To a mighty close pal of mine.

He used to play it right here
I forget the year around '45, I think
Ha, I could tell you quite a story friend
If you'd care to buy me a drink.

Well, I possessed by every weakness
That takes a man a fool
I bought a round, he drank it down
And then he rocked back on his stool.

He said, Yeah, I remember now
It was '45 alright.
He just returned from the Great War
That's where he lost his sight.

His buddies gave him that guitar
At the time it was simple and plain 
He added the gold and the diamonds
As he played his way to fame.

He was doing a show in Shreveport
The night he received a call
To come appear on the Grand Ole Opry
The greatest show at all.

I was driving him to Nashville
It was cold and misting rain
The signals flashed and the whistle screamed
I swear Mister I never saw that train.

I heard the doctor tell him
Just after he used his knife
You're lucky son it was just your arm
It could have been your life.

But he died that night, life just demanded
More than he could give
I think he couldn've made it
He just lost his will to live.

But this world's loss is heaven's gain

He plays with a band of angels

There ain't no fun in this town anymore my mind is weary and my heart is sore
I will admit that I've had fun before but there ain't no fun in Detroit anymore

They can give what I got coming to the poor

For killing a man in Arkansas
Funny thing about it
Joe Bean has never been to Arkansas
On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man
In fact, today is Joe Bean's twentieth birthday

See through the prison bars
Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand
Just twenty short years from the day you were born
You died by the hangman's hand.

Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
For a shooting that he never did
He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid.

Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did.

Well, Joe - your mother is at the Capitol
Asking the governor for a stay
And it's hard on her
'Cause she knows where you were, on that particular day
You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe.

Well, the telegraph wires are humming
Here, the governor's words come through
He said, ""I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean, I'll do
I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you
Happy Birthday, Joe Bean.""",Joe Bean,Everybody Loves A Nut,1966,11,1:45,Track 'B6',Album,False
688,N/A,Webb Pierce,"The orchid is a flower that blooms so tenderly
To thrill the fairest lady of the land
If placed beside a blushing rose, the rose could not compare
But how was such as I to under-stand

I overlooked an orchid while search-ing for a rose
The orchid that I overlooked was you
The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue
The orchid now I find my dear was you

The rose has lost it's color but the orchid is the same
And I'm alone to face these lonely years
I didn't see the orchid 
I was looking for a rose
And now I pay the price with bitter tears

I overlooked an orchid while search-ing for a rose
The orchid that I overlooked was you
The rose that I was searching for has proved to be untrue
The orchid now I find my dear was you",I Overlooked An Orchid,Where'd Ya Stay Last Night,1967,12,2:23,Track 'A2',Album,False
