0,1,Clint Black,"Move slowly to my dresser drawers, put my blue jeans on
Find my cowboy boots, my button down, strap my timepiece on my arm
Grab my billfold, my pocket change, just a mindless old routine
Then it's out the door and down the street, but it's not really me

I still comb my hair the same, still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pickup truck that the same old bank still owns
But since you left, everybody says, I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on, but nobody's home

Cup of coffee in the mornin', it's just food for the brain 
But I've been numb since our last goodbyes, I haven't felt a thing
But now there's pains in my head and pains in my chest, and I think I'm losing my hair
I'm a half a man with half a mind, to think you didn't care 

I still comb my hair the same, still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pickup truck that the same old bank still owns
But since you left, everybody says, I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on, but nobody's home

As they are on this damned old L.A. street

And fell limp, against my side

Round our house the grass was green
It didn't seem like things were all that bad
I bet we walked a thousand miles
Chopin' cotton and pushin' plows
And learnin' how to give it all we had.

As life went on and years went by
I saw the light in daddy's eyes
And felt - the love in mama's hands
They kept us warm and kept us fed
Taught us how to look ahead
Now lookin' back, I understand.

Old times there are not forgotten
Those fertile fields are never far away
We Were Walkin' in High Cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.

We dressed up in hand-me downs
Just in time, to gather with the church

And how it impressed me then
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.

With a rusty advertisement, dangling by a nail
Says Popcorn and Pepsi for a dime.

There's a hobo with his three-legged hound
Waitin' for a train, that no longer comes

There's a young man, sits by the river
Got his head held down in his hands
There's a lost love in every teardrop
And reasons that he just don't understand.

There's a dirt road that runs by the river
Comes an old man, stepping high
With a soft voice and kind intentions
He said, son you know you're too young to cry
Some things were meant to just roll by.

You've got to learn to let it go,
When love lets you down
Learn to let it go,
So you don't miss the one waiting to be found
With a love that's going to bring you around
Only love is going to bring you around.

But when I lost her to another
That's when I found the momma of my child

360,N/A,Paul Overstreet,"We started out to walk through life hand-in-hand together
We ran into some trouble on the highway to forever
Took a turn that turned out wrong, woke to find the feeling gone
But I know that we'll recover if we hold onto each other

Let's take another run at it, baby, take another run at our love
Let's have a little fun with it, darling, it don't have to be so serious
Don't tell me that it's over, and we can pick the pieces up
Let's take another run, take another run at our love

Sometimes the mountain looks so high when you're standing at the bottom
But once we've made it to the top, we can't see the problem
Right now it hurts a little bit, but we've never been the kind to quit
And I know we'll make it over, and we'll be rolling in the clover

Let's take another run at it, baby, take another run at our love
Let's have a little fun with it, darling, it don't have to be so serious
Don't tell me that it's over, and we can pick the pieces up
Let's take another run, take another run at our love

Now if we walk away and say we tried
We'll never know what's on the other side

Let's take another run at it, baby, take another run at our love
Let's have a little fun with it, darling, it don't have to be so serious

And you need someone at your side
I'd like to be the one to share your load
The loving arms where you can come and hide

When the world weighs on your shoulders
When your heart is down and blue
And that old Kentucky wind keeps blowing colder
I'll take care of you

I'll take care of you every night and every day
Through the years we'll watch our love grow
Hand in hand together every step along the way
Without a doubt, darling, you will know

When the world weighs on your shoulders
When your heart is down and blue
And that old Kentucky wind keeps blowing colder
I'll take care of you
