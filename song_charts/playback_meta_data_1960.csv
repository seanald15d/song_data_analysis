0,1,Elvis Presley,"Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know, someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was when we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I've never known

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain?
Shall I come back again?

Lets pretend we're together all alone

And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

Whisper to me tell me do you love me true
Or is he holding you the way I do
Though love is blind make up your mind I've got to know
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go

You can't say the words I want to hear
While you're with another man
Do you you want me answer yes or no

North to Alaska, go north, the rush is on

Big Sam left Seattle in the year of '92
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon River and found a bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome
Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow
With the Northern Lights a runnin' wild in the Land of the Midnight Sun
Yes, Sam McCord was a mighty man in the year of nineteen-one

North to Alaska, go north, the rush is on
Way up north to Alaska, way up north to Alaska
North to Alaska, go north, the rush is on

George turned to Sam with his gold in his hand
Said, ""Sam you're a lookin' at a lonely, lonely man
I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of golden place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
I'd build for my Jenny a honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain just a little southeast of Nome""

On a Mississippi riverboat
I used to be known from coast to coast
As the slickest gambler afloat.

I've dealt the cards from Minnesota
To the harbor in New Orleans
I made a lotta big money on the riverboat
I loved a lotta pretty riverboat queens.

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail.

Oh, a big man got on the riverboat
Our last time in St. Paul
He had a lotta money but his luck went bad
And the riverboat won it all.

He said I dealt from the bottom of the deck
And he pulled a shiny knife
But before that gambler lunged at me
My .44 took his life.

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail.

Well, they came on the boat and they took me to jail
When we got to Tennessee
A gamblin' man has very few friends
Guess nobody cared for me.

So I might be here for a many long years
But if I ever get out 
I'm gonna head straight for that levee
And get me a riverboat headin' south.

Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows every-body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh he might have went on living but he made one fatal slip

The Germans had the biggest ships that had the biggest guns
The Bismark was the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas
On her deck were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees

Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And ev'ry British seaman he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismark, the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees

We gotta sink the Bismark 'cause the world depends on us

The Bismark started firin' fifteen miles away
We gotta sink the Bismark was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away the mighty Hood went down

For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people put ev'ry ship a-sail
'Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismark to the bottom of the sea

We'll find that German battleship that's makin' such a fuss

We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down

The British guns were aimed and the shells were comin' fast
The first shell hit the Bismark, they knew she couldn't last

Sink the Bismark was the battle cry that shook the seven seas

When a Ford and a Mercury went out to play
Well this is the inside story, and I'm here to say
I was the kid that was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
And that Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got twelve cylinders, uses them all
With an overdrive that just won't stall

Its got a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
4:11 gears, you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, and I'm not scared
The brakes are good, and the tires are fair

We left San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
Everything went fine up the Grapevine Hill
We was passing cars like they was standing still

And all of a sudden like a flick of an eye
A Cadillac sedan had passed us by
The remark was made ""There's the car for me""
But by then the taillight were all you could see

Now the fellas ribbed me for bein' behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
I took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive

Well, I wound it up to a 110
Twisted the speedometer cable off the end
I had my foot feed clear to the floor
Said that's all there is, and there ain't no more

Went around a corner and I passed a truck
I whispered a prayer just for luck
Fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guys beside me were white as a ghost

I guess they'd thought I'd lost my sense
The telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots""

Smoke was rollin' out in the back
When I started gainin' on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him, and hoped I could pass
But when I did, I'd be short on gas

Went around a corner with the tires in the side
You could feel the tension, man what a ride
I said, ""Hold on, I've got a license to fly""
And a Cadillac pulled over and let me by

And all of a sudden a rod started knockin'
When down in the dips, and she started to rockin'
I look in my mirror, and a red light was blinkin'
Cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln

Well they arrested me and put me in jail
And called my pop to throw my bail

Remembering the days that used to be.

For he recalls when dreams were new
He loves someone who loves him too

I went to school on many a day with faded old blue jeans
The patches they were many, the seat was all thread bare
But a poor girl didn't notice and a poor boy didn't care

A poor boy don't have no money, a poor boy don't have no dough
Give a poor boy a pretty little girl and watch that poor boy go
He's the backbone of the nation, the pappy of the land
With a two buck loan he'll build him a home
And raise him a poor boy clan

His worries they are many, his pleasures are but few
But that don't worry a poor boy his pappy had 'em too
His living don't come easy, he has to sweat it out
But he'd rather be a poor boy than a wealthy gad-a-bout

A poor boy don't have no money, a poor boy don't have no dough
Give a poor boy a pretty little girl and watch that poor boy go
He's the backbone of the nation, the pappy of the land
With a two buck loan he'll build him a home
And raise him a poor boy clan

If it wasn't for the poor boy a lot would go un-done
The plow would never furrow or the mill would never run
There wouldn't be no taters, there wouldn't be no beans
The rich would all be poor boys in faded old blue jeans

A poor boy don't have no money, a poor boy don't have no dough

I was lonesome for the love I've left behind
So I stole love happiness my heart could find
From a German girl there on the River Rhine

She thought I was free right from the start
I said love words like an actor plays his part
Till one day I knew I meant then from the heart
I'd found fraulein love there on the River Rhine

In the cold and lonely River Rhine
Lies my little darling my fraulein

From the bank she took her life
I lost her to the lonely River Rhine

It was hard for me to tell her how I'd lied

Ev'ry day I listen to the surging tide,
And I always wonder why the sea's so wide;
Miles of salty water, endless skies above,
Stretch out far between me and the one I love.

Rockin' rollin' ocean,
With your briny foam,
Bring my sweetheart back to me,
Bring my darling home.

Ev'ry night I wander down beside the sea,
Callin' to the wind to blow her back to me;
Now my arms are empty, since she sailed away,
Only stars to hear me when I kneel and pray.

Little drops of water, little grains of sand,
Make a wide, wide ocean in a lonely land;
When a new ship anchors and she don't appear,
I make the ocean wider with another tear.",Rockin' Rollin' Ocean,The Hank Snow Four/Square Album,1962,10,,Track 'A4',Single,True

Still hears my broken song of love

On a Mississippi riverboat
I used to be known from coast to coast
As the slickest gambler afloat.

I've dealt the cards from Minnesota
To the harbor in New Orleans
I made a lotta big money on the riverboat
I loved a lotta pretty riverboat queens.

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart

Oh, a big man got on the riverboat
Our last time in St. Paul
He had a lotta money but his luck went bad
And the riverboat won it all.

He said I dealt from the bottom of the deck
And he pulled a shiny knife
But before that gambler lunged at me
My .44 took his life.

Well, they came on the boat and they took me to jail
When we got to Tennessee

Guess nobody cared for me.

So I might be here for a many long years
But if I ever get out 
I'm gonna head straight for that levee
And get me a riverboat headin' south.

You asked me not to call you on the phone
But there's something I'm wanting to tell you

You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life

To the places where the wine and liquor flows
Where you wait to be anybody's baby

On a Mississippi riverboat
I used to be known from coast to coast
As the slickest gambler afloat.

I've dealt the cards from Minnesota
To the harbor in New Orleans
I made a lotta big money on the riverboat
I loved a lotta pretty riverboat queens.

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail.

Oh, a big man got on the riverboat
Our last time in St. Paul
He had a lotta money but his luck went bad
And the riverboat won it all.

He said I dealt from the bottom of the deck
And he pulled a shiny knife
But before that gambler lunged at me
My .44 took his life.

Riverboat, riverboat
I love your whistle's wail
I wish I was back on the riverboart
'Stead of in the Memphis jail.

Well, they came on the boat and they took me to jail
When we got to Tennessee
A gamblin' man has very few friends
Guess nobody cared for me.

So I might be here for a many long years
But if I ever get out 
I'm gonna head straight for that levee
And get me a riverboat headin' south.
