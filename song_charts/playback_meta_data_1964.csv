0,1,Bobby Goldsboro,"See the funny little clown
See him laughing as you walk by
Everybody thinks he's happy
'Cause you never see a tear in his eye

No one knows he's crying
No one knows he's dying on the inside
'Cause he's laughing on the outside, mm
No one knows, no one knows

See the funny little clown
He's hiding behind a smile
They all think he's laughing
But I know he's really crying all the while

How his heart is aching
How his heart is breaking on the inside
But he keeps laughing on the outside, mm
No one knows, no one knows

This funny little clown
You never used to see him around
Without his girl beside him
To love and guide him

Until one day his girl just walked away
And to this very day he says
""He never loved her anyway""

Too many times he came home with too little pay

The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me, ""That son of a Saginaw fisherman""
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand

But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich, and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan

He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said, ""Son, you wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim""

Who worked down near the Georgia Line
As D.J. in a little country station
Everybody loved him dear
'Cause he played what they liked to hear
He built himself a quite a reputation

At record hops he stayed out late
And his mom would always wait
To see if he had made it home alive
She warned against his loss of sleep
And driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five

B.J. the D.J. you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways
Don't see how you can last

Every morning just past four
From the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again
Then at breakneck speed he'd drive
To sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin

His mom said by the radio
Until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright
Then she'd say a little prayer
Giving thanks that he was there
And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn
All the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time
BJ had a lot of nerve
But he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio
The voice she heard she didn't know
B.J.'d never been this late before
But with the road so bad and all
She'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

All dressed up to the brim
Said he'd just came down from a place
Called ""Highland Rim""
Well, he said he came to ride the horse
The one they call ""The Brute""
But he didn't look like a cowboy
In his Continental Suit

We snickered at the way he dressed
But he never said a word
He walks on by the rest of us
As if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man
Who could ride this wild cayuse
A meaner horse was never born
Than the one they called ""The Brute""

The horse that he was looking for
Was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly
Put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a thoroughbred
When he pulled his sack of ""Dukes""
From the inside pocket
Of his Continental Suit

Well, he rolled hisself a ""Corley""
And he lit it standing there
Blew himself a smoke ring
And he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy
When he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was
Fifeteen hundred pounds of hate

The Buckskin tried to run him down
But the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms
Around the horse's neck
And pulled himself up on the back
Of the horse they called ""The Brute""
Sit like he was born there
In his Continental Suit

""The Brute's"" hind-end was in the air
His front end on the ground
Kickin' and a-squealin', tryin' to
Shake this stranger down
But the stranger didn't give an inch

Ashamed that he'd been rode
By a city cowboy in
Some Continental clothes

And we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from
And we haven't seen him since

Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian, a proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

Nor the Marine that went to war

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill

And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Celebrated through the land

And when did the Indians dance

I took the wreath off the door and somehow I stumbled inside
I just can't I just can't I said live without her
Give me one reason to live now that my darling has died.

And then five little fingers
Touched my hand
Five little fingers
Too young to understand.

And there was a softness in my little girl's touch
That seemed to say daddy I need you so
And in five little seconds her five little fingers
Told me all that I wanted to know.

I could tell her little eyes were full of questions
I tried to answer but all I could do was hold her tight
Forgive me forgive me I said for crying
But darling your daddy has got such a load on his shoulders tonight.

And then five little fingers
Soft and dear
Touched me on the cheek
And gently brushed away a tear.

And I knew that in her own little way
My baby was saying daddy I love you so

In the arms of a poor mountain man

184,N/A,Marty Robbins,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved

So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life; nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me

Still not as warm as the lips that I waited to kiss

Secora had promised to meet me in San Angelo
I was aware of the chance I was taking
I was an outlaw but great was my love for this girl

I must be with her I can't stay away
Nights spent without her are lonely and so are the days
If it means death then I'll have to chance it
Only a few minutes more and she'll be at my side

At ten o' clock in the morning
I tied my horse and I started to walk down the street
Where was Secora, had she forgotten
This was the day and the hour that she wanted to meet
But something is wrong with our plans and I fear death awaits me
Here on this hot dusty street.

Up on a housetop but still I can see
There hides a man with a rifle, it's pointed at me
I might escape from the man with a rifle
But there are others just like him that I cannot see

Back of each window the click of a gun
Die if I stay and my love for her won't let me run
Where is Secora, will my eyes see her
Then in a moment she runs from a door down the street

""Up on your horse"", she is crying
""Ride out of town it's a trap and they're waiting for you""
But if I ride out, she must ride with me
Then in a moment I know that our chances are gone
For a bullet is well on its way and it finds my Secora
She cries as she falls in my arms

Over and over her soft lips did say
""Now we're together, I won't let them take you away""
One little sigh, her little lips tremble
Then it was over, Secora had drifted away

Tears dim my vision but plainly I see
The ranger that killed her is standing there waiting for me
I rise to meet him, my one thought it beat him
He deserves death and I swear that this ranger will die

I beat his draw and I shot him
Shot him six times just as fast as the bullets could fly

Or down affections cloudless sky.

And felt the pulse beat fast, lorena,

Sleep on! nor heed life's pelting storms.""

Lost forgotten with no place to go

Said pardon me Mister now don't get me wrong I don't want your money
Though heaven knows I could use it
But you see this is my home and you see the other bar down the street
Well that's my home too
I noticed you starin' at me a while ago you recognized me didn't you
I said yeah Joe I know who you are
You was one time a real famous singing star one of my favorites
He said well I guess you heard they took my babies away from me
I said yeah Joe I read about it in the papers
Then he turned his head away and I saw the tears fall in the place
And he turned to me and he said you know Mister
This is the only place in the world that I'm not ashamed to show my face
But I'm gonna quit yes sir I'm gonna quit
And I'm gonna cut my hair and shave and get me a clean white shirt
Then I'm gonna walk up to her door
When she answers I'm gonna stand up real proud and tall
Then I'm gonna get on my knees
Then I'll say sweetheart if you'll take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life makin' up to you for what I've done
I'm so ashamed of myself and this I want you to know
Then I'm gonna take my two little babies and I'm gonna hold 'em so close to me
I ain't gonna never let 'em go

Indestructable memories are passing in review
Impossible though things may get improbable I will forget
Indelible memories of sweet a loveable you

Those arms're not real but somehow I feel
If I'd just close my eyes then maybe it will last

And the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God discloses
And he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known

He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me...

Then I dream about Where Love Used To Live dear
And all the things that I let slip away
With that One Exception I had never cheated
But Temptation And The Wine they both were strong
Now we're left with the Marriage On The Rocks dear
Where used to stand the Sweet And Happy Home
I'm still singing the song Almost Persuaded
And darling You Still Mean The World To Me
And I'm sure that we could always be together
If you'd only Have A Little Faith in me
Now you're back and Already It's Heaven
And I should Thank My Lucky Stars above
That My Woman's Good To Me and now forever
