My love won't age at all

2,3,Joe Diffie,"Well, I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before 
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door 
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man

When I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruising the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said, ""I never knew you were a pickup man""

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
'Cause there's something women like about a pickup man

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

A bucket of rust or a brand new machine
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill

Two shadows starting to softly combine 
The picture they're painting 
Is one of the heart

It's a true work of art 

Oh, the red strokes 
Passions uncaged 
Thundering moments of tenderness rage 
Oh, the red strokes 
Tempered and strong 
Burning the night like the dawn

Inspired by a vision 
That they can't command 
Erasing the borders 
With each brush of a hand 

Oh, the red strokes

Thundering moments of tenderness rage

Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy please, don't take the girl

Said if you do what I tell you to there, won't be any harm

Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me, here's the key to my car
Mister give it a whirl

My head fell dense
I splashed it with water tryin' to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen
She was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just gimme that wink

Slam-bam I'm feelin' all right
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

Well it's her way of sayin' she's on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin'
And I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

It may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cure

Says don't wait up for me,
I'll be workin late tonight.
Wife hangs up the phone bursts into tears
Calls her sister up and cries get over here.

Sister tells her boyfriend be back in awhile
Boyfriend wants a beer, the store is just a mile.
Leaves the motor runnin' he'll only be a minute,

Driver tells his buddies, got one life to live
They scream into the night, let's get it over with.

The kid guns the gas, car starts to swerve
Heads for a semi-truck, jumps the curb
Truck hits a bigboy in the Shoney's parking lot
Flies through the air, takes out the bank clock
Clock strikes a light pole, transformer sparks
Lines go down, town goes dark.

Waitress calls the cops says she saw it all
Swears a giant alien has landed at the mall
Cops ring up the mayor says there's panic in the street,
Hate to wake you up but we can't find the chief,
Mayor says use your head, if he ain't in his car

Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces
Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride

Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight
And while the bridges burn
Another hard hard lesson's learned
As in the ashes, passion slowly dies
And this romance goes down to foolish pride

He relives every word they spoke in anger
He walks the floor and punches out the wall
To apologize to her, would be so simple
But instead he cries, ""I'll be damned if I crawl.""

If he loses her, he's lost his best friend
And more than just a lover can provide
So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him
Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride

Turn out the lights, the competition's over
The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight

Now there's nothing like a real good friend to tell your troubles to,

Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour 
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night 
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene 
In John Deere green

They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard 
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene

There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it

I watched your father give you away
Your aim was true, a pink bouquet
It fell right into my hands

We danced for hours and we drank champagne
You screamed and laughed when I got up and sang
And then you rode away in a white Mustang
To your castle in the sand

Through the years and the kids and the jobs
And the dreams that lost their way
Do you ever stop and wonder
Do you ever just wanna say

Hey, Cinderella, what's the story all about
I've got a funny feeling
We missed a page or two somehow
Oh, Cinderella, maybe you could help us out
Does the shoe fit you now

You're older but no more the wise
But learn the art of compromise
Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry
And sometimes we just break down

We're good now 'cause we have to be
We come to terms with our vanity
Sometimes we still curse gravity
When no one is around

Yeah, I don't gather dust in the corner of the attic
Bicycle rusting in the rain
Still we walk in the fabled shadow
Sometimes we call her name

Hey, Cinderella, what's the story all about
I've got a funny feeling
We missed a page or two somehow

As it blew through the trees and the trees would bend
I can recall the smell of the rain
On a hot summer night
Coming through the screen

I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast
Its light all around your room

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs
Staring up at the blue and the blue stared back

I used to believe we were just like those trees
We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased
With our feet on the ground and our arms in the breeze
Under a sheltering sky

Twirl me about, and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
And when I look up at you looking down,
Say it was only a dream

A big truck was parked in the drive one day
They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine
And this kid sister thing was old by that time

But oh how our dreams went bump in the night
And the voices downstairs getting into a fight
And the next day a silence you could cut with a knife
And feel like a blade at your throat

Twirl me about and twirl me around
Let me grow dizzy and fall to the ground
When I look up at you looking down
Say it was only a dream

The day you left home you got an early start
I watched your car back out in the dark
I opened the door to your room down the hall
I turned on the light
And all that I saw
Was a bed and a desk and couple of tacks
No sign of someone who expects to be back
It must have been one hell of a suitcase you packed

Twirl me about, twirl me around

With a heart shaped honeymoon suite

At our desks and at dinnertime
Reminded of the starving children
We cleaned our plates with guilty minds

And the stones in the road
Shone like diamonds in the dust
And then a voice called to us
To make our way back home

When I was ten, my father held me
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning
Pass slowly through our town

His widow kneeled with all their children
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer
With all the cities burning down

And the stones in the road
They flew out beneath our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires
As we raced each other home

And now we drink our coffee on the run
We climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons
And here's the line that's missing

The starving children have been replaced
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass
And hope our eyes don't meet

We pencil in, we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass, we make you hold
We doctor the receipt

Late one night when the wind was still
Daddy brought the baby to the window still
To see a bit of heaven shoot across the sky
The one and only time daddy saw it fly

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
The neighbors had a party on their porch
Daddy rocked the baby mother said amen
When Halley came to visit in 1910

Now back then Jackson was a real small town
And it's not every night a comet comes around
It was almost eighty years since its last time through
So I bet your mother would have said amen too

As its tailed stretched out like a stardust streak
The papers wrote about it every day for a week
You wondered where it's going and where it's been
When Halley came to Jackson in 1910

Now daddy told the baby sleeping in his arms
To dream a little dream of a comet's charms
And he made a little wish as she slept so sound
In 1986 that wish came 'round

Oh the years have turned my bitterness
Into a sad regret
And it's good to finally talk to you
And lay our past to rest

But you were oce my friend

In the workshop where he spent his extra time
Was a dusty wooden box that I had never noticed 'til that night
Then we set it on the table; carefully, we opened up the top 
And stared into the memory 
Daddy kept inside the box 

There was a letter from Mamma, when she went out to Reno
To help her sister out in '62 
And a flower from Hawaii, when they went on vacation 
It was the first time that my daddy ever flew

And the pocket knife I gave to him on Fathers day
Years ago; I thought it had been lost
We all thought his heart was made of solid rock
That was long before we found the box

I guess we always knew it, but ""I love you"" was hard for him to say
Some men show it easy, and some just never seem to find the way
But that night I began to see a softer side of someone I had lost 
I saw the love he kept inside the first time when we opened up the box

There was a picture that was taken, when he and Mom were datin'
Standing by his 1944
And a faded leather Bible he got when he was baptised
I guess no-one understood him like the Lord

And the poem that he had written all about his wife and children
The tender words he spoke were quite a shock

Me and the boys that I knew in school
Are thirty years old, stubborn as a herd of mules
We get all cleaned up on a Saturday night
We say yes to the girls when they ask if they look all right.

Load up the cars and ride around
Roll down the windows and we go to town
And we talk too slow, drive too fast
We're high on life and we're low on gas
Tryin' to make the way things are
The way things used to be
The boys and me.

The phone rings, it's the call of the wild
And the clothes we wear have finally come back in style
We got some tall tales that we love to tell
They may not be true but we sure do remember them well.

We work hard to have a little fun
Roll up our sleeves and get the job done son
And we talk too slow, drive too fast
We're high on life and we're low on gas

There was a pretty little baby boy
It seems like I remember sadness
Mingling in the joy
For Mary saw the future
And the sadness it would bring
And that's when Mary started crying
When she heard the angels sing

Let's make a baby king
Let's make him Lord of all
Let's give him everything
Let's make a baby king

Now, you remember little King David
He's the little baby's kin
He's cousin to the man named John
And I know you all remember him
And John said, ""Let's get ready!""
The herald angels sing
'Cause this old world needs to know
The good news that I bring

Back when things were never hard
I used to play there in that yard
And I just drove by to see if things had changed

And across the street at the Five and Ten
A lot of things were cheap and square and strange
And the life we had might have been
But it was one we loved believing in
And I just drove by to see if things had changed

I wondered now
If love is still the way it was back then
I need to know 
That life is still a place worth living in
There it is, just like it was

Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law if you drink
Don't drive do the watermelon crawl

Said let me show you somethin' that you ain't ever seen
