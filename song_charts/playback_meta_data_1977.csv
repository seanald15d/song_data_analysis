Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

Say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry

Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late

2,3,Kenny Rogers,"In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her, she said, ""I'm no quitter
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings""

In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused; he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shakin', his big heart was breakin'
He turned to the woman and said

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

After he left us, I ordered more whisky
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door

And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

Here you come again

4,5,Glen Campbell,"Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night
Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when you close your eyes
I apologize to anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies?
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through your soul
Like the stories of old

Old man, he and his dog
They walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da........

Many others in the trees

So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words he would reveal

Blowing steady and strong behind me

So I packed up my car, and then I called my Mom in Tennesee, and told her what I planned to do. She said, ""Son, are you comin' by?"" And I said, ""Mom, I'm really pushed for time, but I'll see you in a week or two."" 

And I was drivin' through this little town in Georgia when I remembered: today's Mama's birthday. Well, I thought I'll just stop and wire some flowers. Shouldn't take too long; then I'll be on my way. 

So I walked in a flower shop and the first thing I saw was this little boy, with his eyes full a' tears. I said, ""What's wrong, son?"" He said, ""Mama loves roses. And today's her birthday, and I haven't seen her in almost a year."" 

Roses for Mama
Today's her birthday

He said, ""I live with Grandma now. But I promised Mama some roses, 'cause I talk to her all the time. I wanted to give her five, 'cause that's how old I am. But the lady said I couldn't buy 'em with just a dime."" 

Well, the little fella's story kind a' touched my heart, so I told the lady to give him what he wanted and charge it to me. Then I told her I needed to wire a dozen roses to my Mama, up in Chapel Hill, Tennessee. 

I looked around, and the little boy was gone. But all of a sudden the door flew open and he come runnin' back in and he said, ""Mister, I forgot to thank you for the roses."" He smiled, he shook my hand, and ran back out again. 

Well, I started on out of town. And I was feelin' real proud of myself for thinkin' of my Mama and really carin', when I looked out the window and I saw that same little boy, kneelin', by a grave in an old cemetery. 

I stopped my car and walked over to where the little boy was kneelin' down. And he smiled up at me and said, ""This is where my Mama stays. She says she sure does thank you for these pretty roses."" Well that's when I had to walk away. 

And I drove straight back to that flower shop and I said, ""Lady, have you sent those flowers to Tennessee?"" She said, ""No, not yet."" I said, ""Well, nevermind. I'll just take them back with me.""

Neon lights from an old beer sign
Shown through the window out on the sidewalk
As I walked in to pass the time;
I looked around, sat down at a table
Ordered beef on rye and a glass of wine
And through the door came a little old lady
She was selling paper roses and they only cost a dime.

Paper Rosie, Paper Rosie
She sold you Paper Roses, But they only cost a dime.

Silver hair that's lost its' Gold
Trembling hand as she passed the rose
Red Crepe paper, made nature's bouquet
Help a little old lady buy a rose today;
I took the rose from her trembing hand
With eyes of age, she smilled and walked away
Like a breath of spring I could smell the rose
It came alive and I heard her say.

Buy my Roses, pretty roses
They're only made of paper
But they only cost a dime.

I went to look for her outside
A spray of roses lay by her side
The sky lit up and the choir sang

To keep his belly still

In his faded tight legged jeans

Where I was pickin' songs just to get along
A Denver woman so fine she took my breath away

Warmer than the sweet red wine she's drinkin'
What comes next I suppose is no surprise

'Cause the first time she let go was in my arms
She's as pure as a Rocky Mountain airy breeze
She said I always knew that it would take a special man for me
And the first time she let go it was me

But the fireplace has a warm and friendly glow

He was tryin' to thread it on there when the fire fell off a' his cigar and dropped on down, sorta rolled around, and then lit in the cuff of Earl's pants and burned a hole in his sock. Yeah, sorta set him right on fire. 

I looked on outta the window and I started countin' phone poles, goin' by at the rate of four to the seventh power. Well I put two and two together, and added twelve and carried five; come up with twenty-two thousand telephone poles an hour.

Well we shot that tunnel at a hundred-and-ten, like gas through a funnel and eggs through a hen, and we took that top row of chickens off slicker than scum off a Lousiana swamp. Went down and around and around and down 'til we run outta ground at the edge of town. Bashed into the side of the feed store... in downtown Pagosa Springs.

Come on, Frank."" (Dog's name is Frank.) 

Well, we all went past the chicken house, through the hog pen, down to the tractor shed, and then wound up in back of the barn in a field of cowpies. And settin' right there in a pool of grease was a half-ton Chevy pickup truck with a 1960 license plate, a bumper sticker says ""Vote for Dick"" and Brillo box full of rusty parts, and Bob says ""Whaddya think?"". 

Well, I kicked the tires and I got in the seat and set on a petrified apple core and found a bunch of field mice livin' in the glove compartment. He says, ""Her shaft is bent and her rear end leaks, you can fix her quick with an oily rag. Use a nail as a starter; I lost the key. Don't pay no mind to that whirrin' sound. She use a little oil, but outside a' that, she's cherry."" 

I says, ""What'll take?"" He says, ""What've you got?"" I says, ""Twenty-eight dollars and fifteen cents."" He says, ""You got a deal. Sign here, I'll go get the title and a can full of gas."" I put the nail in the slot and fired 'er up; she coughed and belched up a bunch a' smoke and I backed her right through the hog pen into the yard. 

Well, Frank jumped in and bit my leg and I beat him off with a crowbar. He jumped on out and the door fell off and the left front tire went flat. I jacked it up and patched the tube and Frank tore a piece of my shirt off. Then Bob come out and called him off and says ""You better'd get on out of here."" 

I went left on the one-lane gravel road, went fourteen west on County 12. Took two full quarts of forty-weight oil just to get her to the Conoco station.

Kickin' tires, and swattin' flies,
And discussin' the State of the Union
When right out in front of the Baptist church
Come a big ol' purple school bus
Had astrological signs upon it
And thirty-five hippies and dogs inside
About half of 'em went for the courthouse lawn
And them dogs commenced on the fireplug
Rest of 'em set there starin' at us
And I says, ""Roy, go get your Flit gun""
He says, ""Which is the hippies? And which is the dogs?""
I says, ""Beats the hell outta me, Roy.""

Prepare to disembark, men.
Get the incense goin' and the sitar out
We gonna camp in the city park, man."" 

I says, ""Boys, let me explain the situation to ya.
A: you're gettin' me down
And B: we got us a leash law here
And C: you in the wrong town.
You drop one string a' beads in that there park
And you gonna see a whole lotta stars.

Or we gonna blow ya ta Mars.""

And proceeded to the city limits.

Says a mess a' wild Critters was in it!
So we all got in the Marshal's Plymouth

Went flashin' on down to the swimmin' pool

Them critters is all had their pants down
Them dogs was tearin' the bathhouse apart,
And they's after the fish in the fish pond!
I says, ""Roy, you get the one in the silver T-shirt
""And I'll get the rest with a net.
We gonna have a jail full a' naked Crispy Critters 
And a drip-dry space cadet."" 

Well, we gave 'em hell, but we lost the war
'Cause them Critters outnumbered us
So they moved in and set up camp
And they lived in that purple school bus
Six weeks later, there was nothin' in town
But eighty-four dogs and a head shop
Sellin' dried up weeds, and sunflower seeds,
And astrological postcards

McCall,"Me an' RJ an' the kids was on a camp-out in the mountains, and we had us one'a them U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep cars which we rented from a fella by the name of Kubozke for thirty bucks a day, buy your gas along the way, take a rabbit's foot and leave a pint of blood for a dee-posit.

And he 'splained it all to us how we was supposed to get to Telluride, which is fifty miles away by way of the regular highway, however, there was a shortcut but unless we had drove the Black Bear Road before, we'd better be off to stay, stay in bed and sleep late. (Pay no attention to the gitar there.)

Well, we took up off'n the highway and we come upon a sign says ""Black Bear Road. You don't have to be crazy to drive this road, but it helps."" I says, ""RJ, this must the shortcut road Kubozke was talkin' about."" She didn't pay no mind, 'cause she was makin' peanut butter sandwiches for the kids in the back seat throwin' rocks and drinkin' Kool-Aid and playin' count-the-license-plates. But they wasn't havin' too much fun a-countin' license plate or cars, 'cause there weren't no other cars.

We went about a mile-and-a-half in about four hours, busted off the right front fender, tore a hole in the oil pan on a rock as big as a hall closet. Went over a bump and spilt the Kool-Aid and Roy Gene stuck his bolo knife right through the convertible top and the dog threw up all over the back seat. Peanut butter don't agree with him, you see.

So we had to stop and take off the top and air everything out and clean it up. The dog run off and RJ says she felt her asthma comin' on. I was sittin' there wonderin' what to do when the en-tire scenic San Joo-wan U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep car sank in the mud. At thirteen thousand feet above sea level.

Well, we shoveled it out and ate our lunch, the dog made a yellow hole in the snow and Roy Gene got out his Instamatic and took a snapshot of it. Mary Elizabeth drawed a picture of the road; it looked like a whole bunch a' Zs and Ws all strung together. And RJ took one look at it and said that the only way that Jeep car is goin' down that road is over her dead body. Then a rock slipped out from under the wheel and the U-Drive-'Em Army Jeep car went right over the edge of the cliff. Yahoo-ooh-ooh-ooh!

270,N/A,C.W. McCall,"One night last summer we were camped at ten thousand feet up where the air is clear, high in the Rockies of Lost Lake, Colorado. And as the fire burned low and only a few glowing embers remained, we laid on our backs all warm in our sleeping bags and looked up at the stars. 

And as I felt myself falling into the vastness of the Universe, I thought about things, and places, and times. 

I thought about the time my grandma told me what to say when I saw the evening star. You know, Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight. I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.

The air is crystal-clear up here; that's why you can see a million stars. 

I remember a time a bunch of us were in a canyon of the Green River in Wyoming; it was a night like this. And we had our rafts pulled up on the bank an' turned over so we could sleep on 'em, and one of the guys from New York said, ""Hey! Look at the smog in the sky! Smog clear out here in the sticks!"" And somebody said, ""Hey, Joe, that's not smog; that's the Milky Way."" 

Joe had never seen the Milky Way. 

And we saw the Northern Lights once, in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. They're like flames from some prehistoric campfire, leaping and dancing in the sky and changing colors. Red to gold, and blue to violet... Aurora Borealis. It's like the equinox, the changing of the seasons. Summer to fall, young to old, then to now. And then tomorrow... 

And then everyone was asleep, except me. And as I saw the morning star come up over the mountains, I realized that life is just a collection of memories. And memories are like starlight: they go on forever.",Aurora Borealis,C.W. McCall's Greatest Hits,1978,12,3:24,Track 'B6',Single,False

Blue turned into green then it was red
And stirring the night love music played the light
I saw in the night was a penny arcade

Hey step up and play each machine seemed to say
As I walked round and round the penny arcade
Just ring the bell on the big bagatelle
And you'll make all those colored lights cascade
And music played at the penny arcade
Yes it played and it played, played all the time
Roll up and spend your last dime

At first I thought it a dream that I was in
Lost, lost in a sea of glass and tin
But no, so dipping my hand in the back of my jeans
I grabbed a handful of coins to feed the machine

Oh!

Well, I've heard it said that this is true
And who knows I might do it again

And I could use son some advice
But take it from the man who's done it twice

But something always gets in your way

And I think she'd die of a broken heart
Without me what would she do

But it hurts him more to take his pride and run his life
