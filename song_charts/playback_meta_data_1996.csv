Don't you know I've come a long, long way

There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my piece of mind

You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

She is the sunlight when the skies are grey
She treats me so right lady take me away

That's a newly sharpened blade
That's a dagger to the heart
Of the promises we made
That's a chapter full of pain
A season full of rain
A dark and stormy night
Spent all alone

Get scattered by the wind
Tossed upon the waves
Lost for years on end

Slowly drift apart
They give away their hearts
Maybe call you
Now and Then
But you wanna be
Just friends

You say you love me very much
And you'll always hold me dear
Those are the sweetest words

A flame without a fire
Can't warm me late at night

And buy a one way ticket on a west-bound train
See how far I can go (Because I can)
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know (Because I can)
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly

When freedom was waiting, down at the station

On my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge 
And he had a car
Yeah, I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

I still remember 
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September 
When he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste

Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine
Like strawberry wine

The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen a plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much
Yeah

The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
And green on the vine

And all of the guys are wishin they hadn't been so blind
She's taken a shine to life

Rosie hardly ever missed a bit of work
Never took vacation days
Home or the diner it was all the same to her
She didn't know any other way
But each afternoon now she starts to come alive
Cause Jesse's there each day to pick her up at five

She's stronger than she ever knew

We're from two separate worlds.""
And he admitted she was partly right.
But in his heart's defense, he told her
What they had in common was strong enough to bond them for life.
He said, ""Look behind your own soul and the person that you'll see
Just might remind you of me.

I laugh,
I love,
I hope,
I try.
I hurt,
I need,
I fear,
I cry.
And I know you do the same things, too.
So we're really not that different, me and you.""

Now she could hardly argue with his pure and simple logic,
But logic never could convince a heart.
She had always dreamed of loving someone more exotic,
And he just didn't seem to fit the part.
So she searched for greener pastures, but never could forget
What he whispered when she left.

Was it time, or was it truth?
Maybe both led her back to his door.
And as her tears fell at his feet,
She didn't say 'I love you',
What she said meant even more...",,,,,,,,

Giving up and just walking away
Forever's just another word

You've got to treat her right, understand
That she's your woman and you're her man
Tell her that you need her
Like the desert needs the rain
And if you treat her right, show her you care
When you need her she'll be there
Like an island in the storm, a beacon in the night
If you love her, treat her right

A good woman ain't easy to find
The faithful and the loving kind
And if you don't hold her tight
She'll slip right through your hands

So be willing for her sake
Stand by her when the strong winds blow
Even when it hurts, don't let go

Not a penny to their name
They believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same

And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying day

They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test a time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in bind

And they made their house from a toolshed
Grandaddy rolled out on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home

And they taught us 'bout good living
And taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

My mama raised five children
Four girls, and there was me
She found her strength in faith of God
And a love of family

She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
To pay a bill or two

And my daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had

He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
Folks drove the cars from miles around
And let 'em look underneath the hood

Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne

Raised at the fork in the road in a clapboard house
And Rachel was a land baron's daughter
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth
Her daddy said he wouldn't stand
For Rachel to waste her life with a common man
He tried hard to keep them apart
But you can't draw lines in a young girl's heart

He knew his place, it was right beside her
Step by step up to her world
Head over heels for a brown-eyed girl
And gettin' caught didn't seem to matter
'Cause heaven was waitin' at the top of Jacob's ladder

It'll be five years September
Since her daddy found the ladder and a note on her windowsill
He swore he'd never forgive them
But nothin' melts a heart like a grandchild will
Now she climbs up on his knee
Says, ""Grandpa tell a story, the one about me""
He thinks back and his eyes shine
Says, ""Listen child, once upon a time""

And prone to blow his stack
Kenny Dean was in the suicide scene
And sneakin' behind Joe's back
Sneakin' around with Joe's girl June
She liked the boys in the band
And when they all got together on Saturday night
It was easy to understand why

They called it Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
There's drinking and dancing to the music of Bobby Lee and The Blackjacks
It was Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
If you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee

Now the owner of the place was a man named Jack
And he wouldn't take talking back
He was married to a woman named Mae
She took up the slack
He knocked ya out and she'd drag ya out
And leave ya in the parking lot
And when you'd wake up in the mornin' with a busted head
You're just happy that was all you got

Come Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
They was drinking and dancing to the music of Bobby Lee and the Blackjacks

It was Saturday night at the paradise knife and gun club
If you was looking for some trouble you could find it I guarantee

Well the night that Joe Bob found out that Kenny Dean Was sneakin' around with June
He caught Bobby Lee in the band in the middle of an old Hank William's tune
And Bobby Lee cried out your cheatin' heart
That was just the spark it took
And when the fighting got started
Everybody took part and that whole damn building shook
Till the sheriff came out and he stopped the bout
Hauled everybody to jail
When the judge saw the blood and the chewed up ears
He turned a whiter shade of pale
He said good God y'all what's happened here
Somebody started World War III
Kenny Dean just grinned the best he could and said
Your Honor it seems to me like it was just another

On an old forgotten trail
Six cowboys and one old man
In another day of hell
Chuckwagon laggin' behind
From the strain of a broken wheel
The only thing to look forward to
Is a campfire and a meal

Sleepin' beneath the open sky
With just the stars above their heads
A saddle for a pillow
And some sagebrush for a bed
Waking up tomorrow
Was merely done by chance
Back when the west was wild
And cowboys didn't dance

When cowboys didn't dance,
Didn't wear designer shirts
Their hearts were filled with memories
And bodies filled with hurt
They would sit around the campfire
And exchange a piercing glance
Back when the west was really wild,
And cowboys didn't dance

More coffee from an old tin cup
More sweat upon the brow
Another day of chasing
That same old lonely cow
And every new horizon
Began a brand new day
Thirteen-hundred miles to go
As they slowly made their way

Across the plains of Texas
Through the Colorado snow
Final destination,

Not a penny to their name
They believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same

And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying day

They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test a time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in bind

And they made their house from a toolshed
Grandaddy rolled out on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home

And they taught us 'bout good living
And taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

My mama raised five children
Four girls, and there was me
She found her strength in faith of God
And a love of family

She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
To pay a bill or two

And my daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had

He never made the front page
But he did the best he could

And let 'em look underneath the hood

It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""
She said just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you

She said, ""Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy
Don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now, don't let me down, now,

Well, that was the last time I saw my Mama
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
Wasn't very long till I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about

I knew what I had to do
And I made myself this solemn vow
I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name

Don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy,
Don't let me down""

Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pourin' his tea

I charmed a king, a congressman,
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat

Hypocrites who call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out

Where do I go to start all over
When in your arms is where I won't be

I'd take some things and leave, If the change of scenery
Would do me any good, Like I know it should
I'd still be missing you, What goods a different view
To a broken heart, We'd still be apart
Someday I'll find the answer, To this mystery
But tonight the same old question, Just keeps on haunting me

I was born in Oklahoma in 1969
My daddy played the honky tonks
Out on the county line
One night he took me with him
Through those swingin' doors
And I heard that country music
Saw that crowded dance floor
Dad made fifty dollars
And I stayed up 'til three
And I thought
This is the life for me

By the time I turned fourteen
I was pickin' lead guitar
Everyday I went to school
And at night I played the bars
Two or three years later
I noticed something strange
All the looks that I was gettin'
From the girls began to change
I knew right then and there
What I was gonna be
This is the life for me

This is the life
The only one I want to know
Everyday another town
And every night another show
Ever since I was a boy
I've had this crazy dream
Now I know it was meant to be
This is the life
This is the life for me

Well I tried to go to college 
Just to see if I was wrong
But that ain't the kind of knowledge
That helps you write a country song

Through a cloud of smoke so thick
That you could cut it with a knife

You know this airport's open every day

Roll up our sleeves and keep this love alive

Back when all we had was love and dreams
Before we knew it baby, something happened
Dreams got put aside to make ends meet

Love's a gamble every heart will take

And I hold the winning hand anyway life deals the cards
No way to lose, 'cause, I've you my ace of hearts

Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
