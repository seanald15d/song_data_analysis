0,1,Ned Miller,"From a Jack to a King
From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
And walked away with your heart

From a Jack to a King
With no regret I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
To make me King of your heart
For just a little while
I thought that I might lose the game
Then just in time
I saw the twinkle in your eye

From loneliness to a wedding ring
I played an Ace and I won a Queen
You made me King of your heart

1,2,Claude King,"They say don't go on Wolverton Mountain if you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clovers has a pretty young daughter
He's mighty handy with a gun and a knife
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey and Wolverton Mountain protects her there
The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers if a stranger should enter there

All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and climb that mountain
Though Clifton Clovers he might take my life
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...

I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain it's too lonesome down here below
It's just not right to hide his daughter from the one who loves her so
Her tender lips are sweeter than honey...

I told her about our great sin.
Mary cried and forgave me,

Said if I wanted my freedom
I could be free ever more.

Mary cry anymore.

Down in our shack by the sea.

Trapped no more by your charms,

Devil Woman, you're evil,
Like the dark coral reef.
Like the winds that bring high tides,
You bring sorrow and grief.
You made me ashamed to face Mary.
Barely had the strength to tell.
Skies are not so black.

Runnin' as fast as I can.

Glad I'm comin' home again.

Cause another tear to fall.

7,8,Walter Brennan,"(Words and music by Crofford)

How old was I when I first seen old Rivers?
I can't remember when he weren't around
Well, that old fellow did a heap of work
Spent his whole life walking plowed ground.

He had a one-room shack not far from us
And well, we was about as poor as him
He had one old mule he called Midnight
And I'd trailed along after them.

He used to plow them rows straight and deep
And I'd come along near behind
A-bustin' up clods with my own bare feet
Old Rivers was a friend of mine.

That sun'd get high and that mule would work
Till old Rivers'd say, Whoa!
He'd wipe his brow, lean back on the reins
And talk about a place he was gonna go.

He'd say, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there among the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'
And there ain't no fields to plow.

--- Instrumental ---

I got a letter today from the folks back home and
They're all fine and crops is dry
Down at the end my mama said, Son
You know old Rivers died.

Just sittin' here now on this new-plowed earth
Trying to find me a little shade
With the sun beating down 'cross the field I see
That mule, old Rivers and me.

Now, one of these days
I'm gonna climb that mountain
Walk up there among the clouds
Where the cotton's high
And the corn's a-growin'

Big trophies I've hung on my wall
My mansion sits high on the hilltop
And the world is impressed by it all.

But to me always all this glory is worries
And I've not been successful enough
For while I was thrilling the whole wide world
I was losing your love.

I forgot to kiss you
And hold to your charms

To these empty arms.

10,11,Bill Anderson,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad
Of the old homeplace where I grew up of the days both good and bad
My overalls were hand-me-downs my shoes were full of holes
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and yet our homefire never flickered once
'Cause when all these things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
And come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again
And when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down
And he'd read it read it loud and long
And I always felt that maybe our house was blessed
When daddy would say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan
By then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong
And those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor
For you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this world is a better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flod my soul)",Mama Sang A Song,Mama Sang A Song,1962,2,3:02,Track 'A',Single,True

That I'd laugh when you walked away

It's on a little ol' hillside farm
Ma pa raised six kids and one of 'em was me
In the fall of the year when the fields got white
We'd start pickin' cotton about daylight
And on Saturday pa would take it all to town

Then along about dark when everything was still
We could tell it was pa comin' down the hill
'Cause he'd rear back and he'd sound off something like this
Uh huh uh uh uh uh uh ha ha ha ha ha
Uh huh uh uh uh uh uh ha ha ha ha ha

We'd go out to meet him with a lantern light
'Cause the road got crooked on a Saturday night
And he'd come on down the hill and he'd stop in the yard
He'd sit up there on the wagon seat and he'd say boys I'm hard to beat
Two hundred pound of steel and twice as hard

Got him right and woolly and full of flees
And I never been carried by old knees
Then he'd rear back and below out a chorus or two
Uh huh uh uh uh uh uh ha ha ha ha ha
Uh huh uh uh uh uh uh ha ha ha that's my pa

Got him rough and ready and about half wild
And he'd whip anybody about half a mile
'Cause there wasn't anybody else there 'cept me and little Skeet
He was just as tough as a hickory brien
And I could dive deeper and came up drier
And he did it too right off that wagon seat

Well it shook him up when he hit the ground
But pa got up and looked around
And then reared back and he let us have it again

For the crew had little hope
Two were dead, some were wounded, all were clinging to the bow
Fightin fire, fightin water, trying to save their lives somehow.

With his strap, between his teeth, he towed the irishman to the sea.

36,37,Jimmy Dean,"Dear daughter, I tiptoed in your room tonight and I looked down at
You smilin' in your sleep. You were so lovely my heart nearly broke;
And I thought how much like Sleeping Beauty a little girl is. When I
Tuck you in at night I never know how old you'll be when you wake. One
Evening you crawl on your dad's lap and throw your arms around his neck,
The next morning you might be much too grown up for that sort of thing.

You're so quickly approaching the awkward age, too young to drive the
Car and yet too old to be carried in the house half asleep on daddy's
Shoulder. I have a secret that I've never told you, Sleeping Beauty,
You're going on a very exciting trip. You'll travel from yesterday all
The way to tomorrow. It's a rapid journey and you'll travel light,
Leaving behind you measles, mumps, freckles, bumps, bubble gum and me.

I promise not to feel too hurt when you discover that the world is more
Important than your daddy's lap. Yesterday you were blue jeans and pig tails,
The neighborhood's best tree climber. Tomorrow you'll be blue organdy and
Pony tails and you'll view the world from a loftier perch - a pair of high
Heel shoes.

Yesterday you could mend a doll's broken leg with a hug; tomorrow you'll
Be able to break a young man's heart with a kiss. Humh! Humh! Yesterday you
Could get lost one aisle away from me at a supermarket now I have to worry
About losing you down another aisle to some strange young man. You see,
Just at the point where you're growing pains stop, mine begins. Yesterday
You were kind of a pain in the neck when you were around, tomorrow you'll
Be an ache in my heart when your not.

Tomorrow you'll lay aside your jump rope and tie up the telephone lines
And that little boy that used to push you in the mud; well, he'll fight to
Sit out a dance with you. The clock is countin' the minutes for you and the
Sky upstairs is savin' its' brighest stars; - and the sun is waitin' with
Its' shiniest day.

Oh I, I can't expect you to live in a doll house forever. Sooner or later,
The butterfly sheds it's cocoon and the smallest bird must try its wings.
But when you grow up and out of my arms; when you finally get too big for my
Shirts, I'll still recall how you used to scatter dust and dolls and partially
Through every room in the house; but you spread sunshine too. The dust is
Settled, your mom picked up the dolls; but the sunshine will always fill
The corners of our hearts.

So, here I am talking in your sleep, because, well if you saw this look on
My face, you'd laugh and if I spoke with this lump in my throat, I'd cry.
Yea! honey when I looked at you tonight you were a Sleeping Beauty. So, I
Tiptoed over and I kissed you you didn't wake up, I knew you wouldn't.
According to the legend only the handsome young prince can open your eyes
And I'm just the father of the future bride.

So you sleep on pretty thing, tomorrow you'll wake and you'll be a young
Lady and you won't even realize that you've changed courses in the middle
Of a dream. But you might notice a little change in me; I'll look a little
Different somehow. A little sadder, a little wiser, but a whole lot richer.

Told me not to call her on the telephone

My head went a-spinnin' around
But with a little bit of luck, and my little black book
I'll have another'n before the sun goes down

What my baby didn't know was the same thing happened
Not once, but a half a dozen times
And she didn't realize that with a telephone call
I'd have another fickle chicken on the line
But every time I leave I do my best to play the part
Of the lovesick, heartbroke clown

61,62,Jimmy Dean,"She kinda breezed into town from New Orleans
And said, ""Boys, I'm Big John's Cajun Queen
Now I didn't come here to argue or waste anybody's time
I just came to get my man from your dirty old mine
'Cause he moves me""

""Now where you give up's where old Queenie's gonna start
'Cause I got a powerful love in my heart
So just show me the hole way down in the ground
And tell the whole wide world Big John's been found
And he's livin'""

So down in the mine without a sign of a light
Old Queenie went a-lookin' for John that night
She found him there at the bottom of the pit
And placed a red hot kiss on those cold blue lips
He started breathin'

She waited a minute and then she kissed him again
And old John got the power of a hundred men
Up he come a-clawin' and a-diggin' like a mole
And said, ""Come on Queenie, we're gonna leave this hole""
They started walkin'

Now a roar from the crowd greeted this fine pair
As they both walked out in that cool night air
And up for silence went Big John's hand
And the Queen said, ""I told you I'd get my man
'Cause he moves me""

You can find them today, they're down in New Orleans
Big Bad John and his Cajun Queen
They're a little bit wrinkled from the strain of time
But their love's just as strong as that night in the mine
A hundred and ten grandchildren

Has a real clear omen

Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around. 
And all the girls from there to Austin,
Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelery in hock.
To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box. 

And he would play:

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: ""Don't stop.""
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play:

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him. 
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

Please do what I say

My daddy was working
For the weather station
A little bit North of Nome
And I grew up in that frozen country
Where the nights are six months long

I used to play like I was an Eskimo
I put whale oil on my hair
And every night I would beg my folks
Let me sleep in the frigid air

I was seventeen and my voice was changing
But the girls didn't thrill me none
'Cause I longed to go see an Eskimo
On the banks of the old Yukon

One night I slipped from my daddy's house
A little bit north of Nome
I knew that I could get back by morning
'Cause the nights are six months long

And there she was
Sitting on a chunk of ice
Eating a frozen fish
And dipping her friskies
In whale blubbe

And I said, ooga shooga mooshka
Which means the love in my heart
Is a burning

And she said, ooga mooshka nooshka
And that means, back up, buddy
You're melting the ice

I went back home and I told my daddy
About this maiden fair
And how I felt I'd love to melt
Them icicles in her hair

And his breath began to freeze

I could never rub noses
With pretty little Um Shog Nee

Well, the Eskimo and the white man
Were having a lot of wild parties, see
The Eskimos always brought the ice

Well, they's having a lot of fun, you see
So one night, this Eskimo named Pie Eye

He stole my little boy and made
A icicle out of him

So I stole you to get even
I was gonna make a
Fudgesicle out of you

But I loved you like you's my very own
And I treated you just, you know
Just like the cold blooded
Little Eskimo that you are

Rub noses with Um Shog Nee no more

With two big mules and sweat and tears
And a good woman who lent him a hand.

Them boys of his hand land of their own

When his wife gave up, took their three kids and left him

The darkness will turn to light and the storm will calm

And soap she made herself from fatback and bacon rinds from hogs she'd help feed
And on those Saturday nights the roads got a little crooked
And pa'd come home with the wrong kind of load

And driving fast in that old heap
And that he had to be at work by five

B.J. the D.J. you're living much too fast
And if you don't change your ways
Don't see how you can last

Every morning just past four
From the driveway he would roar
Overslept and he was late again
Then at breakneck speed he'd drive
To sign the station on at five
He had lots of records he must spin

His mom said by the radio
Until his voice told her hello
She knew then that he made it there alright
Then she'd say a little prayer
Giving thanks that he was there
And she'd wait up for him again tonight

Then one cold and rainy morn
All the tires were badly worn
But still he screeched off just as fast this time
BJ had a lot of nerve
But he completely missed the curve
And he signed off down near the Georgia Line

Mom sat by the radio
The voice she heard she didn't know
B.J.'d never been this late before
But with the road so bad and all
She'd wait a while before she called
And then she heard the knock upon the door

They kept my dad in the Macon jail
Dad said, ""Son, if you keep your hands clean
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail""

We robbed a man in Tennessee
The sheriff caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key

I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands but they didn't come clean
Tried to do like daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

Asked the jailor when's my time up
He said, ""Son, we won't forget
And if you try to keep your hands clean
We may make a good man of you yet""

Without water in the blistered sun
And in Spain I stood calmly without even a cape

Bound and tied a gagged and nailed in a barrel I went over Niagara oh yes
But baby last night when you said you loved I turned into a quivering mess

Cause women do funny things to me women do funny things to me
I'm usually perfectly calm and colective and curious as I can be
But ruby lips swingin' hips bitter minds tender sighs
Pretty curles and flirty girls I see they do funny things to me

Without a guide or a gun I went a huntin'
Killed a tiger with my two bare hands
Without a rope and barefooted I climbed Mount Everest
And didn't even get a blister on my hand

And the snakes and skeeters and flies

I said Lord I can't stand it I'm gonna die
