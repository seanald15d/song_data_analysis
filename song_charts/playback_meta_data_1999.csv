0,1,Faith Hill,"I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face
And I've never been this swept away
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear is the beating of your heart

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now

'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

Caught up in the touch

1,2,Lonestar,"Every time our eyes meet
This feelin' inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
For ever and ever

Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

Done almost everything a boy can do

5,6,Tim McGraw,"When all our tears have reached the sea.
Part of you will live in me.
Way down deep inside my heart.
The days keep coming without fail.
A new wind is gonna find your sail.
That's where your journey starts.

You'll find better love,
Strong as it ever was,
Deep as the river runs,
Warm as the morning sun.
Please remember me.

Just like the waves down by the shore,
We're gonna keep on coming back for more.
'Cause we don't ever wanna stop.
Out in this brave new world you seek
O'er the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top.

You'll find better love,
Strong as it ever was,
Deep as the river runs,
Warm as the morning sun.

When snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor.

6,7,Tim McGraw,"It was Labor Day weekend I was seventeen
I bought a Coke and some gasoline
And I drove out to the county fair,
When I saw her for the first time
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there
Oh, a sailor sky made a perfect sunset
And that's the day I'll never forget

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Well it was five years later on a southbound plane
I was headed down to New Orleans
To meet some friends of mine for the Mardi Gras
When I heard a voice from the past
Comin' from a few rows back
And when I looked, I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said I bet you don't remember me
And I said only every other memory

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
You were killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget something like that

Like an old photograph
Time can make a feeling fade
But the memory of a first love
Never fades away

I had a barbecue stain on my white t-shirt
She was killing me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a sun tan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
A heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget
I said a heart don't forget something like that
Oh, not something like that",,,,,,,,
7,8,Jo Dee Messina,"He left me cryin' late one Sunday night
Outside of Boulder
He said he had to find himself
Out on the road
I guess when love goes wrong
You've gotta learn to be strong
So I worked two jobs and I moved three times
I ended up south of Memphis
Workin' down in Riverside
I may not be so lucky in love
But the one thing I'm sure of

I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that wanna hold me
Not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart
Stand beside me
Be true
Don't tell lies to me
I'm not lookin' for a fantasy
I want a man who stands beside me

I didn't expect to see him
One hot July mornin'
His hair was longer but his eyes
Were the same old blue
He said, I've missed you for so long
Oh baby, what can I do?

I said, I want a man that stands beside me
Not in front of or behind me
Give me two arms that wanna hold me
Not own me
And I'll give all the love in my heart

It's hard to tell him no when I want him so bad
But I've got to be true to my heart
This time

I'm not lookin' for a fantasy

Watch you smile while you're sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming

I could stay lost in this moment forever
Well, every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

I don't wanna close my eyes

And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wondering if it's me you're seeing
And then I kiss your eyes, and thank God we're together

So tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life

12,13,Alan Jackson,"Let's begin with the day I met her
How fast this good old boys world got better
The sky got bluer, the grass got greener
Just the first few seconds after I first seen her

Like my, favorite song on a new set of speakers
My best old jeans and my broken sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
Sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She's, right on the money
She goes direct, to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Bulls eye perfect
She's, right on the money

She's no red lights, when I've over slept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothin' but net
A hand full of aces when the dealers done dealin'
I'm forever on a roll that's how she's, got me feelin'

She's, right on the money
She goes direct, to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Bulls eye perfect
She's, right on the money

She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt it
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

She's, right on the money
She goes direct, to my heart
When it comes to loving me
She's everything I need
Bulls eye perfect
She's, right on the money",,,,,,,,

It always winds up feeling more like a job interview
My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later, I remember lying there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes

And then, all of a sudden, oh it seemed so strange to me
How we went from something's missing to a family
Looking back, all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

I met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted something more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loved her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, ""Hello"", I miss you so, wish you were here

She got a call that night but it wasn't from him
It didn't sink in right away, ma'am the plane went down

30,31,Steve Wariner,"Two teardrops were floatin' down the river
One teardrop said to the other
I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she just got married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea.

The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea.

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday they'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain
Then they drift on down and ride to the sea again.

Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
An old man sittin' not 10 feet away
Just lost his wife and he said to me
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine
I guess the good Lord giveth and the good Lord taketh away
And we both wiped a teardrop from our face.

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are a part of the pleasure and part of the pain
'Til they drift on down and ride to the sea again.

We'd sit on the bank and watch the world roll by
Our feet in the water, she'd press her lips to mine
We were so long on love but short on time
She could be a honeymoon sweet and a little wild
And she was mine, for a little while

And I laugh every time I start to think about us
We sent that summer out in the style
She's gone but she left with a smile
'Cause she was mine for a little while

We'd take a ride and head on down next to Airport Road
Put the seats back and watch the planes leave town
She always said nobody's strong enough to tie her down
Oh... But I wasn't lookin' for that anyhow
I knew she'd leave but I didn't know when
It matters to me now, but it didn't back then

42,43,Steve Wariner,"My little third grade hand wrote 
""I love you"" on a note of yellow paper, and sent it to 
The front of the room to a little blonde-haired girl.

The blonde-haired girl just opened it, and read it to herself
I was so embarrassed when she turned around and said:

I'm already taken
You spoke up to late
I love somebody else, 
So you'll just have to wait

The years flew by so quickly
And there we were in junior high
I realized that I still loved her so.
So I called her up and told her -
Exactly how I felt

Then she said:
There's something that you really ought to know:

I'm already taken
You spoke up to late
I love somebody else, 
So you'll just have to wait

So wait I did, and never changed my love 
For that little blonde-haired girl- who's now the mother 
Of our little blonde-haired boy - who's to our hearts so close
I hate to think how fast he's growing up.

Last night I overheard them
As she tucked him into bed
He said: mommy, will you marry me?

And this is what she said:

I'm already taken
You spoke up to late
I love your daddy, son, 
So you'll just have to wait.

Learned how to get on with my life

I ran across it just this afternoon
And I realized that I don't ever use it anymore
In fact, last time I did I think it was with you

We had the whole beach to ourselves
And it's crazy now to think
That it's all there on that film and I could take it to the store
To be developed, but what for?
I can still see everything just fine
And who needs pictures 
With a memory like mine

Standin' there I couldn't help
But think about
Everything that might be on that roll
I think it even has another trip we took 
I guess that must've been
At least three years ago

When we were down in Baton Rouge
And there wasn't much to do
So we drove into New Orleans

And I swear that you would think
That it was only yesterday

The less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives
The more that he sees

Stuck between some letters and some keys

I noticed Emily's eyes were green
And how they shined when I made her laugh.

I hated other guys around.

When he caught me stealing my first kiss.

I was so embarrassed when she turned around and said:

I'm already taken
You spoke up to late
I love somebody else,

And there we were in junior high
I realized that I still loved her so.

Exactly how I felt

There's something that you really ought to know:

He wonders could she know
Hidden inside her coat
Are letters his lover wrote

While my baby was sleeping, an angel slipped past
And with one breath said I'm taking him back
To his Father in Heaven

Through gravel and ice and new fallen snow
I held him through my tears
Because I was his lonesome prairie
And he was my wild frontier

Get along, get along, get along
Get along, get along, get along
(Oh oh oh oh oh)
Get along, get along, get along
Get along, get along, get along

Calling out so clear

He held out his arms
And he seemed all alone
So I loaded him up
And I drove him home

Out by my driveway he
Looks down the street
With long hair and sandals made
Of rebar and concrete
I painted him white with a long purple robe
He's a rock of ages on our gravel road

He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
Standing taller than a tree
He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
A bigger man than you or me

I thought losin' my job was 
The end of the world
'Til my best pal ran off with my best girl
I felt suicidal with no real friends
So I walked outside with a rope in my hand

Out by that statue there's a big oak tree
So I stood on his shoulders
And I counted to three
I had every intention of buyin' the farm
But when I jumped off he caught me in his arms

He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
Standing taller than a tree
He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
A bigger man than you or me

I wanted to return the favor to him
'Cause I never had a more solid friend
So I planted some flowers
All around his feet
And I bought him a flock
Of ceramic sheep

He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
Standing taller than a tree
He's an eight-hundred pound Jesus
A bigger man than you or me

She said, ""This is the last thing I expected""
And then she took me by the hand
And said, ""I'll only marry you on one condition""

We're still telling your story

I may not go down in history
I just want someone to remember me

I'll probably never dream a dream and watch it turn to gold
I know I'll never lose my life to save another's soul
But if I will love then I will find
That I have touched another life
And that's something
Something worth leaving behind

Hey baby, see the future that we're building
Our love lives on
In the lives of our children
And that's something

Standing out there in the snow.

We cleaned our plates with guilty minds

And the stones in the road
Shone like diamonds in the dust
And then a voice called to us
To make our way back home

When I was ten, my father held me
On his shoulders above the crowd
To see a train draped in mourning
Pass slowly through our town

His widow kneeled with all their children
At the sacred burial ground
And the TV glowed that long hot summer
With all the cities burning down

And the stones in the road
They flew out beneath our bicycle tires
Worlds removed from all those fires
As we raced each other home

And now we drink our coffee on the run
We climb that ladder rung by rung
We are the daughters and the sons
And here's the line that's missing

The starving children have been replaced
By souls out on the street
We give a dollar when we pass
And hope our eyes don't meet

We pencil in, we cancel out
We crave the corner suite
We kiss your ass, we make you hold
We doctor the receipt

Late one night when the wind was still
Daddy brought the baby to the window still
To see a bit of heaven shoot across the sky
The one and only time daddy saw it fly

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
The neighbors had a party on their porch
Daddy rocked the baby mother said amen
When Halley came to visit in 1910

Now back then Jackson was a real small town
And it's not every night a comet comes around
It was almost eighty years since its last time through
So I bet your mother would have said amen too

As its tailed stretched out like a stardust streak
The papers wrote about it every day for a week
You wondered where it's going and where it's been
When Halley came to Jackson in 1910

Now daddy told the baby sleeping in his arms
To dream a little dream of a comet's charms
And he made a little wish as she slept so sound
In 1986 that wish came 'round

It came from the east just as bright as a torch
She saw it in the sky from her daddy's porch

Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade

I'll order us some coffee
We can talk about old times
When the world still turn our way
And you were mine

Those years with you were the best I ever had
Just seeing you brought those precious memories back


And we had some good times and we had some bad
But the worst times with you were still the best I ever had

Guess we should say good-bye it's time to go
Didn't mean to make you cry I just wanted you to know

Those years with you were the best I ever had
Just seeing you brought those precious memories back
And we had some good times and we had some bad
But the worst times with you were still the best I ever had

Well I changed my ways to please that woman
But I could never be good enough
Yeah, I gave up drinkin' and took up churchin'
And for awhile it wasn't tough
But barkeep I've made a decision after doing the best I could
That for better or worse, I'm gonna be bad for good

So bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for tonkin'
Warn every woman around
I'm gonna wind it up tonight
A little tighter than I should
Yeah for better or worse, I'm gonna be bad for good

I really like my reputation
And how I'm known all over town
Of being the first in my generation
To close every single honky tonk down
I'm gonna be a tough act to follow
Doin' what I said I would
Yeah for better or worse, I'm gonna be bad for good

So bring on the whiskey
Turn up the jukebox loud
These boots were made for tonkin'
Warn every woman around
I'm gonna wind it up tonight

Go tell the sheriff, john roland wood's found Jesus
Now he's living at the foot of the cross
He testified on the main drag this evening
Said he's gonna spread the gospel to the lost

The meanest sinner to ever live and breathe
Said he's been clean and sober for a week
He said his soul is not troubled anymore
He hocked his gun and gave the money to the lord

Go tell the sheriff, john roland wood's found Jesus
At a tent revival right outside of town
Oh what a friend this town has in Jesus
If you look at what john roland has tore down


Before the spirit touched his soul
He kept the streets signs full of bullet holes
Back then when he was raising hell
You knew he was coming by the blue lights on this tail... look out

Go tell the sheriff, john roland wood's found Jesus
Now that water tower must be full of wine
Let not your weary heart be troubled
Turn your women and your children back outside

What will we do on Friday nights
Without john roland shootin' out the lights
Carry that ol' jukebox away
He traded b-9 for amazing grace

Well I can't forget the day we met how I could clearly see
With picture perfect vision, she was the only one for me
My perception of a heavenly love was right there in my sight
I never saw the true writin' on the wall 'cause she was standin' in my light

Bought her a diamond ring, nearly everything this workin' man could not afford
A chevy, a house and the credit cards to her favorite department stores
Loved her all I could, I can't believe she would, run off with some ol' used to be
Guess ya never know what the future holds, 'cause for her it wasn't me

And they say lookin' back is a lesson and that's why I won't forget her
Through the smoke and haze of bein' burned I can see things a whole lot better
Lord I was blind, but now I find since she did me down and dirty
Hindsight's not twenty-twenty, it's more like a 30-30

Now I'm pickin' up the pieces of this shattered broken heart of mine
Been searchin' for the lovin' parts but the hurtin' ones are all I find
When she took her aim she wasn't playin' no games
Lord, she dropped me right to my knees
She untied our knot with a perfect shot and put me into my misery

And they say lookin' back is a lesson and that's why I won't forget her
Through the smoke and haze of bein' burned I can see things a whole lot better
Lord I was blind, but now I find since she did me low-down and dirty

I heard you cry yourself to sleep
And wake up in the night and walk the floor
And I heard you try to tell me something
Just as I was runnin' out the door
And I heard you say ""i love you""
So many times I can't recall
But until I heard you say good-bye
I thought I'd heard it all

No, I hadn't heard the fortress
That I'd built around my ego fall apart
That self-destructing unmistaken cryin'
Of my own broken heart

I heard you whisper little things
No one else on earth was meant to hear


And I can't believe it's possible
You're whisperin' in someone else's ear
Until tonight I didn't know how far
A grown man could crawl
Oh, until I heard me beggin' you
I thought I'd heard it all

No, I hadn't heard the fortress
That I'd built around my ego fall apart
That self-destructing unmistaken cryin'
Of my own broken heart

No, I hadn't heard that little voice inside me
Screamin' fool what have you done
As my tears start fall
And I realize the worst is yet to come

Well it seems these days everybody's in a hurry
First to get the worm them birds are losin' their minds
Well I can say I don't like wakin' up that early
The only way to live is when I'm takin' my time

'Cause life's too short to live it too fast
I can't smell a rose I've already passed
I've learned one lesson to lessen the sorrow
If it's a good idea today it will be a good idea tomorrow

Now I ain't sayin' hard work is no good
We've all got to pull the weight that's on our backs
There's just one thing to remember if we could
All work and no play don't make jack

'Cause life's too short to live it too fast
I can't smell a rose I've already passed


I've learned one lesson to lessen the sorrow
If it's a good idea today it will be a good idea tomorrow

'Cause what's the use in livin', if we ain't livin'
Slow that engine down and enjoy the ride
'Cause there ain't no stoppin' that clock from tickin'
So love the ones you love while you've got the time

'Cause life's too short to live it too fast
I can't smell a rose I've already passed

On any given day I'll catch myself
Talking to yur memory that's all I have left
I miss you more than words can say
On any given day

Baby, on any given day goin' crazy alone
I'll happen by your place takin' the long way home
You'll drive me out of my way
On any given day

Once you hold an angel in your arms
It's the devil letting go
Just a taste of heaven on earth


Leaves a hunger in your soul

If I had three wishes, I'd throw away two
If I could be certain just one would come true
On any given day, I'd take one more night with you
Once you hold an angel in your arms
It's the devil letting go
Just a taste of heaven on earth
Leaves a hunger in your soul

If I had three wishes, well I'd throw away two

Guess I'll be wearin' out another pair of walkin' shoes
Tryin' to reach the place I've always seen myself
And yesterday I thought that I might be right here with you
But today I realize it's always somewhere else

Somewhere down the road
There's a place for me I ain't ever been
Tears may fill my eyes when I go
But my heart seems to be
A dream ahead of me
Somewhere down the road

There's a restless wind blowin' that I need to ride
And I ain't sure I'll ever have a home
I'm just standin' at another place where roads divide
So hold me close tonight, 'cause tomorrow I'll be gone

Somewhere down the road
There's a place for me I ain't ever been
Tears may fill my eyes when I go
But my heart seems to be
A dream ahead of me
Somewhere down the road
