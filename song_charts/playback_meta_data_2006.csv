0,1,Carrie Underwood,"She was drivin' last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow-white Christmas Eve
Goin' home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was runnin' low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long, hard year

She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was goin' way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinnin'
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Just save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

It was still gettin' colder
When she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleepin' like a rock
But for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been livin' my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight

Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on""

Oh, Jesus, take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on

Oh, take it, take it from me","Jesus, Take The Wheel","Jesus, Take The Wheel",2005,2,3:40,Track '1',Single,True
1,2,Carrie Underwood,"Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

Right now she's probably up singing
Some white trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know

Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville Slugger to both headlights

That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin' to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doin' it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone
Still harder: getting up, getting dressed, livin' with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you

Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimmin' hole
It's nice and cold

Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

She's a Saturn with a sunroof, with her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land, and a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation, that I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad, and she's a, lover when she's loving

And she's, everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her I go on and on and on
'Cause she's, everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town, and a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck, and a cuss word 'cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles, baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine, and she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be, and the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet, of my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding, when I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer, and she's the song that I'm playing

And she's, everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her I go on and on and on

Don't cry for me down here

So much pain and so much darkness
In this world we stumble through
All these questions I can't answer
So much work to do

But when I get where I'm going
And I see my maker's face
I'll stand forever in the light
Of his amazing grace
Yeah when I get where I'm going
There'll be only happy tears
Hallelujah
I will love and have no fear
When I get where I'm going

Here in the middle of the road
Standin' there in your rearview
Gettin' soaked to the bone
This land as flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still paryin' I might see
The glow of the brake light

But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss, what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

I held on longer than I should
Believin' you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

But your wheels just turn, down the road ahead
If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
I keep lookin' for the slightest sign
That you might miss, what you left behind
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now

If it hurts at all, you ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot, on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes, baby just one time
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around
I'd settle for a slowdown
Come on just slowdown

And I got up on that high road,
And I did what any gentleman would do...
I, um...

I got a brand new girlfriend.
We went and jumped off the deep end,
Flew out to LA for the weekend,
Spent the whole day, lyin' on the beach,
Wearin' nothin' but a smile,
Playin' kissy-kissy, smoochy-smoochy,
Talkin' mooshy-mooshy bout nothin'.

Yano I feel just like a kid again.

I love it when she calls me butter cup,
Laughs and says I left the toilet seat up,
She pops and tosses me a cold beer,
And says my buddies always welcome here.
When I get hungry, she takes me out.
I ride the shotgun like a shitzu hound.
My tails a waggin', my tongues hangin' out,
It makes me wanna shout...

Thought she might do some cryin': lose some sleep at night.
But he had no idea, when he hit the road,
That without him in her life, she'd let herself go.

Let herself go on a singles cruise,
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu.
Let herself go to New York City:
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty.
When he said he didn't love her no more,
She let herself go.

She poured her heart an' soul into their three-bedroom ranch.
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironin' his pants.
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note,
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go.

Let herself go on her first blind-date:
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake.
Let herself go, buy a brand new car,
Drove down to the beach he always said was too far.
Sand sure felt good between her toes:

She let herself go on a singles cruise,
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu.

Chase your dreams, but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be my little girl

When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes, you're asleep, I whisper ""I love you,"" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, ""Daddy, love you more!""

Beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams, but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be my little girl

Someday, some boy'll come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say, ""Yes,"" to him unless I know
He's the half that makes you whole
He has a poet's soul
And the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough

Sent her down South for some higher education
Put her on the fast track to a law degree

Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer

For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl

Sure did take a toll on his family

Down the street, where I grew up
Momma used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up

I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing

Said he was in the war when in the Navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
""How ya keep from goin' crazy?""

He said ""I'll see my wife and son in just a little while.""
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled said

""I raise my hands, bow my head...
I'm findin' more and more truth, in the words written in red.
They tell me that there's more to life, than just what I can see.
Oh, I believe!""

A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life

She said ""Oh, by the way son...
Old man Wrigley has died.""

Later on that night, I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers, I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody, deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man, who looked me in the eye, said

""I raise my hands, bow my head.

Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay.
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera,
Then in the Manzanillos,
Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico.

After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night.
I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight.
My new-found companion, one young senorita,
Who offered a broken hello,
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico.

She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return,
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern.
'Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo:
That's all I needed to know.
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico.

But instead of being angry
He put his arms around me and said

In the sunlight or the rain brightest nights or darkest days
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
No, your never too far gone
My love is there, wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my baby.

There I was twenty one
Oh I was so ashamed of what I'd done
On a country road
Parked one night
It started out so innocent
Then crossed the line
There was no denying
I let God down
But instead of being angry
He wrapped his arms around me and I heard

In the sunlight or the rain brightest nights or darkest rains
I'll always feel the same way
Whatever road you may be on
No your never too far gone
My love is there wherever you may be
Just remember that you will always be my baby yeah yeah.

There he is my little man
I'm sure he'll get in trouble every now and then
And I pray to God that when he does
I'll be just as understanding
And my father was oh the last thing that I want to do is let him down
So instead of being angry
I'm gonna throw my arms around him and I'll say

On November 8th, 1965, the 173rd Airborne Brigade on Operation Hump, War Zone D in Vietnam were ambushed by over 1200 V.C. Forty-eight American soldiers lost their lives that day.
Severely wounded and riskin' his own life, Lawrence Joll, a medic was the first livin' black man since the Spanish-American War to receive the United States Medal of Honor for savin' so many lives in the midst of battle that day.
Our friend, Nialls Harris, retired 25 years, United States Army, (the guy who gave Big Kenny his top hat) was one of the wounded who lived. This song is his story.
Caught in the action of 'kill or be killed' -- 'Greater love hath no man to lay down his life for a friend'.""

Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota
To fight for the red, white, and blue
He was 19 and green with a new M-16
Just doing what he had to do
He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble
With the smell of napalm in the air
And the sergeant said, ""Look up ahead""
Like a dark evil cloud, 1,200 came down on him and 29 more
They fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne

On the 8th of November the angels were crying
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire raining down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky
1965, the 8th of November

Now he's 58 and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks
About the shrapnel they left in his leg
He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo
And he ties it on one time a year
And remembers that fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with tears

Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky

I woke up today with a headache
More bills to pay than a corporation
Hey, when will it end
My mirror says I could use a break
An easy day, some appreciation
Hey how 'bout a friend
When days like these start to fall in on me
I gotta face my reflection and say... hey

Been burned by the fire
Been stuck under water
Strung up on a wire and still the world goes around
Been tossed like a free throw
Knocked out when the wind blows
Pull the curtain on the hurtin'
'Cause I'm not going down
(I'm not going down no no)

Inside of me is the only
Highway that leads to a true freedom
Holding out it's hand
I close my eyes and it's all right
The sun will shine on a new horizon
Just around the bend
Days like these bring out the strength in me
So I can face my reflection and say...

When someone stood up and tapped a glass with a spoon
It was old Eddie Vicker's granddaddy's best man
And his very best friend to this day
And his eyes grew misty as he raised his champagne

He said, ""Here's to the makers of things built to last
Like church bells and bridges, and baseball on grass
Like Ferguson tractors and Lucchese boots
My daddy's old tools I still use

The pledge of allegiance, the stars and the stripes, 
The words in the Bible, the sun in the sky
And here's to the twinkle in old married eyes
Still there after fifty years past

Disposable honor, replaceable truth
And if a pot breaks, why fix it? Man, what's the use?

And I see there what matters the most in this life
And I have decided I'm takin' a stand

As a funeral procession made its way
Through the gates
I watched it roll up a winding road
Through a field of green
With white headstones
All in a row
And it made me think about where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
All the generous and mostly undeserved
Blessings that I've had

I had an all-American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
Sometimes I can't believe this life in mine
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go

I said a prayer for the dearly departed
And the loved ones left broken hearted
Then traffic started
And I drove away a little more able
To see the good things on my table
And for that I'm grateful
'Cause I've had my troubles and my trials
I've hit the mark and I've missed by miles
Had days that I've been fightin' mad
But the good times have more than
Outweighted the bad

Got to hold my newborn baby girl
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
I've laughed so hard I couldn't stop
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets

Me and Becky didn't waste no time, went zero to 65 one night
Being young was getting old, we were heading down a dead end road
But we didn't care, we were on a roll. Hanging on for the ride
Those lines that we were crossing, carelessly tossing caution to the wind,
Were wearing thin.

We were living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!
Nothing could stop us but one day time caught up with us
And woke us up in the middle of our dream, but not before she loved me.

She loved me.

I think we thought that it would last, but looking back I had to laugh
What a mess we made of that, now I'm not sure that I would want it back
We learned a little bit about love, what it wasn't and what it was
It was fast and it was fun, the beginning of the end of us

One day that road just ran out, but I still travel down it now and then
And once again...

We're living for the minute, loving every second of it
Fearless, wild, and free!

About best friends.

John Roy
Was a boy I knew
Since he was three
And I was two
Grew up two little houses
Down from me.

The only two bad apples
On our family tree
Kind of ripened and rotted
In our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny.

Well now, I was smart
But I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild
With no inhibition
Was about like mixin'
Fire and gasoline.
(And he'd say.)

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas
Drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls
A couple of real hillbillies.

Got a pocket full of cash
And that old Ford truck
A fuzzy cat hangin'
From the mirror for luck
Said, don't you know
All those little
Brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world.

Long around
Our eighteenth year
We found two airplane tickets
The hell out of here
Got scholarships
To some small town
School in Texas.

Learned to drink Sangria
'Til the dawns early light
Eat eggs Ranchero
And throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls
We were majoring in a rodeo.

Ah, but my
Favorite memory
At school that fall
Was the night John Roy
Came runnin' down the hall
Wearin nothin'
But cowboy boots
And a big sombrero.
(And he was yellin',)

Hey, Romeo
Let's go down to Mexico

Want playboys of the southwestern world.

And I said
We had a little
Change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney
Got busted in Japan
And I said
We got waylaid
When we laid foot
On Mexican soil
See the boarder guard
With the Fu Manchu mustache
Kind of stumbled on John's
Pocket full of American cash.
(He said.)
Doin' a little funny business
In Mexico, Amigo.

But all I could think about
Was savin' my own tail
When he mentioned ten years
In a Mexican jail
So I pointed to John Roy and said
It's all his now please let me go
Well, it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed.

Let me tell you
It all started back in 1957 when ole Walt Disney took him by surprise
That's the day Old Yeller died
Well that twelve year old became a man eleven years too soon in Vietnam
With his best friend Tommy
They were tough as nails and southern born and awfully proud to wear that uniform
Then things got scary
On April 4th, Tommy left for heaven the same year the world was taken by surprise
That's the day Martin Luther died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Then what you see there on that barstool with the bourbon on his hand
You heard about his younger years but don't leave now there's more to hear
That might explain the pain in that old man
How quick America forgot about the only war they'd lost and life goes on
That's what they tell ya
No ticker tape no reason why, might have never seen the end of that chapter in his life
If he hadn't met Betty
They married in December 1980, no doubt it was the best day of his life
Two days before John Lennon died
So before you judge him you need to know there's more to that old man
Than what you see there on the barstool with the bourbon in his hand
Now we've covered chapter two I can almost see a change in you
There's still a lot of life in that old man
He hadn't had a drink in at least a year, to tell the truth I'm shocked he's here
But as long as he wants'em I'm gonna pour'em
Before you came in I asked him why, he raised his fragile head and wiped his eyes
Then he told me

My father had skin like leather
Hands like steel
From a lifetime spent in the cottonfields
Though hed come home tired and dirty
Almost everynight
He found the strength to smile at me and hold my mama tight
While that old transister radio would play the opry out in the hall
Id sit and watch their shadows glide across the wall

And theyd dance to a dixie lullaby
Picture of love beneath the southern sky
Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby

I left home at 18
In a hand me down chevrolet
Packed my mamas goodness and my old man's stubborn ways
It was college, work, and love
Then the babies came
The youngest ones got his grandaddy's name
And in the early morning hours when my children could not sleep.
I'd rock them in my arms to a simple beat

And id sing them a dixie lullaby
Hush baby don't you start to cry
Oh my what a beautiful life
Just like a dixie lullaby

My father was a mountain of a man
That was the description that I gave
The morning that we laid him in his grave
There with my mama by his side, we said our last goodbye
To a man we thought would never die
As I stood there in the fields of amazing grace
Oh how the tears ran down my face.

And I sang him a dixie lullaby
Well meet again, by and by

When everything was still
I thought I saw Suzanna
Comin' down the hill

The buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
Says I'm comin' from the south
Suzanna don't you cry

Where do I go from here
When I'm lost out on the road
And the way's not clear
To find my way back home
I need to hear
The only voice that leads me on
So I can find my way back to you

Soon we'll be in New Orleans
Then I'll look around
And when I find Suzanna
I'll fall down on the ground

And if I do not find her
Then I should surely die

I was sunk in my recliner
Football game was one
Tampa Bay in Carolina
I wasn't paying much attention
Volume down, not watching it at all

This house is like an icebox
Had all the curtains drawn
Had it more like a hotel room
And less like a home
Been so quite around here lately
I wasn't thinking anyone would call

Let alone you, all the way from Dallas
Out of the blue, saying that you missed us
And time and distance made you see
You were lost without me
How did you know I'd finally hit the bottom
An all-time low was suddenly forgotten
The sound of your voice on the line
Made fate turn circles on a dime
Just when I thought I'd never find somebody new
Let alone you

Now here I am at the baggage claim
A nervous wreck waiting on your plane
Wringing my hands, checking my watch
Never dreamed forty-eight hours ago
I'd be standing here waiting on anyone
No not anyone

Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave
And me with the frozen heart

It's always there, just outta sight
An' we both know, that love don't live here anymore
You don't have to say it, I can read between the lines

Who's gonna leave an' who's gonna stay
An' how long can this house an' two cars
An' one little girl stand in our way

How long can we keep holdin' on
To somethin' that's already gone?
Girl, life's too short to love like this:
Too tired to try an' too scared to quit
We took to heart the vows we made
But somehow lost the will:
Yeah, we said: ""I do""
But do we still?

Hangin' on the wall is an eight by ten reminder:
You in your gown, me in my rented tux
We had it all when all we had was each other
But now it's gone: that ol' picture gathers dust.

How long can we keep holdin' on
To somethin' that's already gone?
Girl, life's too short to love like this:
Too tired to try an' too scared to quit
We took to heart the vows we made
But somehow lost the will
Oh, we said: ""I do""

The half that makes you whole.
You say you love me with all your heart,
Your body and your soul.
You say your love is an ocean,
Without any shore.
You ask how much I love you:
I love you more.

I'd give you my seat on the train to Heaven,
If only one of us could go.
Give every ounce of blood in my body,
If no pain you'd ever know.
Oh, I'd fight every evil,
That ever came against our door.
I know much you love me,
But I love you more.

Wakin' up with you in the mornin',
Is seein' your smilin' face.
Makes me feel like God,
Has put us in a permanent state of grace.
Your kiss tells me you need me,
Like nobody has before.
You say how much you want me:
I want you...

More, with every day that goes by;
(More.)
When I hold you every night.
Our love will last till the end of time,
Then, baby, we'll find even more.

891,N/A,Rockie Lynne,"Four-thirty a.m., July 28,
In the middle of a storm, never touching the brake,
I drove like a bat outta hell,
Down that lonely ol' four-lane.

With the bright lights of Houston just fadin' behind,
My tires tearin' up the road t'ward the state-line.
I was leavin' the great Lone Star state,
That I loved, for good.

For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana,
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair.
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee,
'Cause wherever she is, boy, that's home for me.
Don't get me wrong:
Love's the only reason I'd ever leave Texas;
She's the only reason I'd ever stay gone.

Just about Baton Rouge, I was changin' my mind,
Thinkin' 'bout all the things I'd be leavin' behind.
Like a Red River sunrise,
And the stars on a Galveston night.

For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana,
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair.
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee,
'Cause wherever she is, boy, that's home for me.
Don't get me wrong:
Love's the only reason I'd ever leave Texas;
An' she's the only reason I'd ever stay gone.

Like a long lonely night,
Wonderin' where I'd spend the rest of my life.
Gone, like an old tumbleweed,
Rollin' his way a place he can't find to call home.

For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana,
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair.
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee,
'Cause wherever she is, boy, that's home for me.
Don't get me wrong:
Love's the only reason I'd ever leave Texas;
An' she's the only reason I'd ever stay gone.

Love's the only reason I'd ever leave Texas;
An' you're the only reason I'd ever stay gone.
