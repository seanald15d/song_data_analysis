0,1,Jerry Reed,"Well me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley
And I kept rollin' them sevens, winnin' all them pots
My luck was so good I could do no wrong
I jest kept on rollin' and controllin' them bones
And finally they jest threw up their hands and said
""When you hot, you hot""
I said ""Yeah?""

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
Put all the money in and let's roll 'em again
When you're hot, you're hot
(La la la la la la la) (La la la la la)
(La la la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot)

Well, now every time I rolled them dice I'd win
And I was just gettin' ready to roll 'em again
When I heard somethin' behind me
I turned around and there was a big old cop
He said ""Hello, boys"" and then he gave us a grin 'n' said
""Look like I'm gonna hafta haul you all in
And keep all that money for evidence""
I said, ""Well, son when you hot, you hot""
He said ""Yeah""

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
You can 'splain it all down at City Hall
I say, yeah, when you're hot, you're hot
You're hot
(La la la la la la la) (La la la la la)
(La la la la la la la, when you're hot, you're hot)

Well, when he took us inta court I couldn't believe my eyes
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
I said ""Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal""
""I'll pay ya that hundred I owe ya if you'll get me outta this spot""
So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around and grinned at me and said
""Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot""
'N' I said ""Thanks a lot""

When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
He said ""Well, when you're hot, you're hot""

I said, ""Well I'll tell ya one thing judge, old buddy, old pal
If you wasn't wearin' that black robe I'd take out in back of this courthouse
And I'd try a little bit of your honor on
You understand that, you hillbilly?
Who gonna collect my welfare?""

1,2,Charley Pride,"Whenever I chance to meet some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smilin' face any time and any place
And every time they ask me why I just smile and say
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin' and love her like a devil when you get back home

Well people may try to guess the secret of happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing

They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me, although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did

Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow clayton around
I often wondered why clayton, who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar and made it down in tenn-o-see

Well, daddy said he drank a lot, but I could never understand
I knew he used to pick up in ohio with a five-piece band
Clayton used to tell me, ""son you better put that old guitar away,


There ain't no money in it, it'll lead you to an early grave.""

I guess if I'd admit it, clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half-stoned a-pickin' out the lovesick blues
When clayton died I made him a promise, I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now

I remember the year that clayton delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
Well, I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do

He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city, bright in the night time like day
There they say he met up with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb, dripped with honey
And something about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm and not alone

Yes Carolyn, a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn, a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home

Where the Willow grew

Where the Silver Leaf of Maple
Sparkled in the Mornin' Dew
I braided Twigs of Willows
Made a String of Buckeye Beads;
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need.

I leaned against a Bark of Birch
And I breathed the Honey Dew

Against a Sky of Baby Blue

And I thanked him for the Song

On which my Mind and Spirit feed;
But Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood
And you're the one I need
Flesh And Blood need Flesh And Blood

I was still not satisfied
For I knew ev'rything I touched
Would wither and would die

I try to save her heart with lies
But I know she knows 
I can see it in her eyes.

I try to stay at home, love only her, 
Play with the kids and watch T.V.
But then my mind becomes unsure 
About the kind of love I need.

My reasons for cheating 
There as good as lies can be
How much more can she stand 
And still stand by me?

It's so hard for me to call her 
I can hardly dial the phone

And in it lived a man I'd never se-e-e-een

But I didn't think nobody could be that mean

So I took me out walking down the rail-road track

An' just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And he growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say"" well, who are you?""
Ooh and there he stood in the door of that shack
And his beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said "" what yuh doing snooping round my place""
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said "" come on in, pull you up a chair,
You might as well since you're already here""
And he said "" you can call me Joshua""

Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the time

I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talkin' straight to you and me

In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a Man in Black

For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been

And I wear it for the thousands who have died

I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died

I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use

There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of

As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me

And, oh, I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it

To bother You with little things

I've watched You with doin' things
And tried to understand You more than most

No, I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought You knew
In my own way I worshiped You
While even Your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way You go about the things You do

I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die, You could have saved

But I believe that in your eyes
This little child was somethin' special
And You wanted it to be with You, no doubt
So without-stretched arms
You beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way You worked it out

Once I saw a young man growin'
Till he neared the age of knowin'
Then I watched as somethin' happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at Your way of bein' kind

They tried everything in vain
And I was there when they explained it
To the family, how he slipped into a trance
Guess You looked into the future
Watched him turn his back upon You
Lovin' him so much You couldn't take the chance

It took a lot of love to die, for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why You've never given up on me

And even when they crucified You

That he beat outta roots from ol' dead stumps on the banks of the Etowah
Made him walk a little funny made his breath smell funky
Well he never came across the river cause the folks didn't like him in town
They said his hair was long his clothes were dirty they didn't want him hanging around

""Charlie, be a man""

Then, see if you can""

Blind with fright and tears won't let me see
Through a door and then, I stop and stare

Faith in God will cause Him to forgive""

Instead of laughing endlessly and pushing back advances with her hands

And it leaves a longing feeling in a man with a pain that lingers on

The gaudy goodbye can't replace the girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up that I'll never ever let her go

Too many nights I've watched her tease by shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands that cover up her satin lips

She struts upon the stage and her fallen victims are calling out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly and exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I'm gonna take her, I've infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore

I decided I'd look up a girl that I once knew
I bought some flowers and went to see a girl I used to know
The lady at her door said she had married long ago

Times will change and towns will change; there I was alone
And suddenly I wondered, ""would susie be at home? ""
So with the flowers in my hand, I walked toward her gate
Someone touched me on the arm and said, ""you'll have to wait.""

Then I noticed there were people standing in a line
And some of them were holding pretty flowers just like mine


They explained that susie had been in an awful crash
Doctors said that she had just a little while to last

When I walked into her room, I felt a sense of shame
But I heard susie whisper, ""I'm awfully glad you came.""
She had been the girl that I had always gone to see
When someone that I cared for had been untrue to me

I handed her the flowers and she gently kissed my hand
She said, ""don't be embarrassed; you know I understand.""
I said, ""goodbye"" and as I bent to kiss her fevered brow
I heard her whisper, ""thank you for the second handed flowers.""",Second Handed Flowers,The Year That Clayton Delaney Died / Second Handed Flowers,1971,2,2:44,Track 'B',Single,False

223,N/A,Johnny Cash,"Orphan of the road
(Dick Feller)
"" © '71 House of Cash""

From a carny show and a rodeo that shared a three-day stand,
A cowboy met a fiery carny queen
In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carny van.
They laughed and loved and shared short-lived dreams,
But the carny show and the rodeo went their separate ways,
And the carny season bloomed and soon moved on,
And I was born on a winter morn to the dark-eyed carny queen,
The too-late son of something that was gone,
The black-sheep child that grew up wild from the seed the four winds sowed,
Unwanted son of ice and fire, an orphan of the road.

I was still a child when my mama died of a chill that closed her eyes,
So I was left to grow up on my own,
Without a name, too wild to tame. No one cared to try.
So mostly I was mostly left alone.
In dingy bars and cold boxcars, hobo jungle camps,
I joined the men who drift from town to town.
The surgin' flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins.
I'd never find the time to settle down.
The black-sheep child...

In the misty rain, I caught the train that slowed down through the town,
And I pulled myself into the boxcar door.
In a passing light in the deep gray night, I saw the still dark form
Of an old man lying sick upon the floor.
And he said ""I tried to find her, but they told me that she'd died,
And that she'd left an only son behind,
And I tried to find him, but I never did, but I know I could rest in peace
If I could just see him once before I die.""
I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flicker and flame,
Then I held it close and I gently raised his head.
""My mother, sir,"" I said of her, ""I have her same dark eyes.""
He smiled a cowboy smile and then was dead.
The black-sheep child...

I know that you've got hair that shines like the morning sun 
You've got eyes that hold the blueness of the sky 
And of the deepest sea on a clear day and a smile that has a sparkle of a diamond 
I know that because I've heard him say those things about you 
These're the thoughts and the words of a man 
Who spent many heart breaking years behind prison walls 
The father of your children the man who worshipped the very ground that you walk on 
He had a picture of you Mrs it was old and faded and torn 
But you could tell at a glance that he never exaggerated in his thoughts and visions 
He never left his cell without first checking to see if he had your picture with him 
He was a young man when he first came to prison 
And he talked a great deal about you but as the years passed he talked less and less 
And during his last year here I don't believe he ever said a word to anybody 
He had the appearance of a man much older than he really was 
He walked with his head down and his shoulders saggin' 
And the walk itself seemed to take a great deal of effort 
He never received a letter or had a visitor while he was here in prison 
But never did he stop looking and waitin' 
Every day at mail call you could see him standing close to his bars 
With the look of a child awaiting a reward 
Even after the mailman had passed his cell his pleading eyes would follow beggin' 
As always he'd feel of his shirt pocket and then just stand there 
Staring at the emptiness and as always I could 
Somehow feel the lump in his throat 
And the burning in his eyes you know Mrs like just before you start to cry 
Well I thought you might like to know that they buried his body today 
Just outside the prison walls 
They buried him there because nobody cared enough to claim his body 
You know there was even a couple of old convicts there that actually cried 
No not because they cared for him but for what he died from they cared for 
Loneliness every prisoner knows loneliness but some know it more than others 
The man that they buried today had died many times 
Every day he waited hopin' and prayin' for a letter or a card 
Or just a note or anything to let him know that somewhere out there 
Somebody cared for him 
That assurance never came and today he died Mrs 
He died from loneliness starved for love a love that nobody ever wanted 
You see no man woman or child is immune to the need of love or to be loved 
No matter how terrible his crime might have been 
The death he died from today was more inhuman 
But his suffering is over now and he's resting in a pauper's grave in a prison suit

Does your hungry arms reach for someone you feel you need

And promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you
I'd just as soon let you go

You'd better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talkin' abou-ou-out

And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone.

And it made me want to smile when I loved her.

About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff

I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough

Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?

Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's... where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took another puff

I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway

The desert floor, I see it there below
A city with a legend -
The west Texas city of El Paso
Where long ago I heard a song
About a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's
Where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl.

I don't recall who sang the song
But I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city,
I remember each and ev'ry word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy
And the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy
Then he had to leave El Paso on the run.

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
The cowboy lived and rode away
But love was strong he couldn't stay
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
I try not to let you cross my mind
But still I find there's just a mystery
In the song that I don't understand.

My mind is down there somewhere
As I fly above the badlands of New Mexico
I can't explain why I should know
The very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear
From life and live another time
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think
That you yourself lived in that other time.

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts
Familar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions
That I've had so long but I have never told
Like every time I fly up through the heavens
And I see you there below
I get the feeling sometime
In another world I lived in El Paso.

El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
Could it be that I could be
The cowboy in this mystery
That died there in that desert sand so long ago
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso",El Paso City,The Greatest Hits Of Marty Robbins,1977,20,,Track 'A1',Single,False
