0,1,Randy Travis,"You may think that I'm talkin' foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how
I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you always will be

But you're not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live
This love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

Oh baby, I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen

They say time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls' brown hair turn grey
But honey, I don't care
I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well I'd love you anyway

They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
But it's easy to see 
It's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you

Oh darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, amen","Forever And Ever, Amen","Forever And Ever, Amen",1988,2,3:31,Track 'A',Single,True
1,2,Michael Johnson,"He asked her, ""What gifts can I bring you
To prove that my love for you is true?
I want to make you mine forever
There's nothing on this earth I would not do""

She said, ""Anything I've wanted
You have given willingly
So now there's only one more thing I need""

If you love me, give me wings
And don't be afraid if I fly

If you love me, give me wings

He walked over to the window
He silently stared into space
Then he said, ""Well, I just want to protect you
'Cause this world is a dangerous place""

She put her arms around him
She said, ""I know you mean well
But there are lessons I must learn for myself""

So if you love me, give me wings
And don't be afraid if I fly
A bird in a cage will forget how to sing
And you can trust me, so give me wings

She said, ""Up above the clouds
You can see forever

If I found you alone like this 
Would I remember 
What I've got at home 
Or forget it all with your kiss 
'Cause when you left me 
I was hurtin' so 
She picked me up off the ground 
And I do love her, I want you to know 
That I never want to let her down 

But you still move me

There's a place inside of me that just won't let you go 
And every time I hold her in my arms 
Or look into her eyes 
I wonder this time, does it show 
'Cause you still move me 

I guess I'd better leave now 
Before it's too late 
Before these feelings go too far

Now you're guilty of this secret love, as I am too 
You'll get used to telling lies, feeling sorry when she cries 
Now that the strings aren't attached, you'll catch on, we've done our part 
Oh, and this is the way we make a broken heart 

Lesson number one, we've just begun to hurt her so 
And with lesson two she'll long for you when lights are low 
And we get to lesson three when she gets down on her knees 
And begs you to stop at the door just before she comes apart 
Oh, this is the way we make a broken heart 

Now we've made a trail of tears for her to follow 
And we've thought of every line that she might swallow 

And with lesson four, there'll be no more for her to bear 
And on some dark night we'll dim the lights on this affair 
Then she'll find somebody new and he'll likely hurt her too

Lord, it's been a long, long time
I know this ain't no social call 
So, go ahead, get it off your mind

You heard what? Well, it ain't true 
I was here most all last night
I got over you the day you left

Money to burn and the girls were pretty

I met Elvis, Marilynand Johnny B. Goode
Got my guitar painted in the California sun
A red Cadillac having to much fun

A million miles from here
When I'm getting close baby say
With a whisper in my ear
How to make you mine

Most the time I don't long to have you with me your memory doesn't get me.
The only time that you still break my heart Is when I'm in somebody else's arms.

Only when I love
Do I think about us and what we lost and could have had together
Only when I hold someone new who could never be you I realize what's gone forever.


No one else has ever touched me like you touched me or loved me like you loved me.

I called you late last night
Or did the sleep get in your eyes
Did it blind me from your sight

Was it hard for you to speak

And did you sing her to sleep
And my pillow that she slept on
Did it bring her sweet dreams
Did you tell her she was sleeping
In the bed you made for me

It was soft with feather down
And the headboard, it came from an old house
That was about to be torn down

And throw it out the door

Growin' up with the sounds of cars and machines
A doctor, a lawyer or a great politician
His family hopes that's what he'll be

Riders on horseback and rodeo scenes
And he knows all he needs is to buy an old pick-up
And drive west till he finds his dream

Could be any boy or girl

To make the payment on my car
Just a weekend stand with a local band
They had me playin' rhythm guitar.

Well, I was singin' some old cheatin' song
When this blue-eyed blonde came by
She said, I'm a table over in the corner
Why don't you drop around and say hi
So, I did.

Well, she was dressed like a million dollars
But she was way up outta my class
She whispered into my ear, honey I hear
A honky tonk man moves fast.

All of the sudden my body went numb
I had enough sense to see
That everything I ever wanted in life
Was coming to easy for me.

So I said, ""Wait just a minute,
Wait, just a cotton-pickin' minute.""

Without your snake boots on
You don't lay down on the railroad tracks
'Til after the train is gone.

You don't swim out in deep water
With your pockets full of stone
You don't get caught in the desert, son,
Without your snake boots on.

Well, she was quicker that a boys good judgment
So, we were headed for the parkin' lot
When a guy in the band said, ""Wait a minute, man
Lord, are you crazy or what?""

""Well, ole big bad Tex is her lover
And, he's terribly skilled with a knife
He's real particular 'bout who rides his horse
And, nobody fools with his wife.""

He was burnin' rubber, halfway to Waco
Destination- liquor store
And though he'd never robbed one before
He made up his mind to do it
Then he'd lay low.

Cause all he thought he needed was a litte bit of cash to roll on
A good set of wheels and some gas to get him there
But all he really needed was something real to hold on to
All he really needed was somebody to care.

There she stood in his lights
With a sign in her hand that just read ""San Antone""
He hit his brakes and he stopped that car
Said I hadn't planned to go that far
But I'll give you a lift to the far side of Waco.

On the outskirts of New Orleans

And Mama'd spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress

Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And she painted my eyes and lips
Then I stepped into a satin dancin' dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where
A half grown kid had stood

She said, ""Now here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy
Don't let me down""

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume
On my neck then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, ""Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death""

She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin', ""Mama, what do I do?""
She said just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you
