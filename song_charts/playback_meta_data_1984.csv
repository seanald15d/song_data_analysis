0,1,Julio Iglesias & Willie Nelson,"To all the girls I've loved before
Who travelled in and out my door
I'm glad they came along
I dedicate this song
To all the girls I've loved before

To all the girls I once caressed
And may I say I've held the best
For helping me to grow
I owe a lot I know
To all the girls I've loved before

The winds of change are always blowing
And every time I try to stay
The winds of change continue blowing
And they just carry me away

To all the girls who shared my life
Who now are someone else's wives
I'm glad they came along
I dedicate this song
To all the girls I've loved before

To all the girls who cared for me
Who filled my nights with ecstasy
They live within my heart
I'll always be a part
Of all the girls I've loved before

The winds of change are always blowing
And every time I try to stay
The winds of change continue blowing

4,5,John Conlee,"She's just a woman
A hundred pounds of flesh and blood
Quick with a smile warm with a touch for me
She's just a woman
And not the least or the most desired
But she sets one man's heart on fire
And it's me that she wants to please.

And in my eyes
God never made a more beautiful girl
In my eyes
There's no one more lovely in all of the world
And she looks at me at times with such surprise
When she sees how special she is in my eyes.

She's only human
And she cries sometimes when she looks in the mirror
And counts a new line that seemed to appear overnight
She's only human
It's not that she's vain, she's just afraid
That therell come a time when Ill turn away at the sight
But I swear that's not right.

And in my eyes
She just grows lovelier to me
And in my eyes
She's only aging gracefully
And a thousand strands of gray wont disguise
The woman shell always be in my eyes.

Sometimes she makes mistakes
But I'm aware of her faults
Her moods go up and down
But that's just because
She's just a woman
And giving her love to only me
Without her help I would be less of a man
Than she thinks I am.

And in my eyes
Love never changes or pretends
In my eyes
Her mystery never ends
And everything I feel as years go by
Makes her love grow sweeter still in my eyes
In my eyes...
She is my woman",In My Eyes,In My Eyes,1983,10,,Track 'B5',LP,True

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor

Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn

Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name and graveyards full of old black men
And graveyards full of rusted automobiles

Say, don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans

Dealin' cards with an old man in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels a rumbling neath the floor
And the sons of poor men porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep rockin' to that gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

Good morning America how are you?
Say, don't you know me I'm your native son

Half way home we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again the passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues

Of a little run-down cabin in the woods
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.

When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.
We lived our day-today in plain dirt fashion,
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.

But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,
And somewhere in between I must have grown
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.
Now I know, it's a long hard road

Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,
When the sun-up came, we got up and went
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent
Singin' songs along with Gramma's radio.

Now I'm beatin' down a ol' blacktop road, sleepin' in a sack,
Livin' in my memories all in vain
'Cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.

Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where my name is known.

Now I'm gone, and it's a long hard road

Of a little run-down cabin in the woods
Where my dad never promised that our blue moon would turn gold
But he laid awake nights wishin' that it would.

When the world was on our radio, hard work was on our minds.
We lived our day-today in plain dirt fashion,
With ol' overalls and cotton balls all strapped across your back
Man, it's hard to make believe there ain't nothing wrong.

But momma kept the Bible read and daddy kept our family fed,
And somewhere in between I must have grown
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
Takes me down the road to where I want to go.
Now I know, it's a long hard road

Sometimes I remember when I stay up late at night,
When the sun-up came, we got up and went
In the shadows of a working' day, our moonlight hours spent
Singin' songs along with Gramma's radio.

Livin' in my memories all in vain
'Cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared to what it's like
To see lightning bugs go dancin' in the rain.

Momma played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade bend,
And raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.

Though we got a little close, there was no slow dance
How the world seems to spin around just for me and you

Such unbridled passion from an innocent start
It stunned us for awhile but now we know what we're gonna do
Gonna make it last, gonna make some dreams come true.

I don't wanna go to the movies couldn't if I wanted to 'cause I'm on trial for lovin' you
Now this all started in a honky tonk just the other side of town
A girl come in took a stool by me ordered gin and drank it down
She lit up a cigarette sexly turned around
Well she said my name is Jannie and asked me what was mine
I answered Hank as I walked to the jukebox droppin' a dime
Checked out her short dress low neck line
Well we danced for five or ten minutes and I held her close to me
Kissed her lips and squeezed her hips and judged about twenty three
Whispered in my ears I said yes siree
Now the scene is a little motel out on the state highway
There in room 12 little love is about to take place
And a state trooper breaks down the door shines a flash light in my face
I said what the hell is this and another man and woman come in
And the girl I'm with starts cryin' and screamin' and she runs over to them
Said thank God you're here he tried to hurt me mama
I said now you don't mean the cop says son the girl is seventeen
So that's why I'm in Knoxville courthouse and the judge passed sentence on me
And it's ten long years for statutory rape in the state penitentiary
Lord I can't believe this is happened to me
So when next time you give a girl the eye she gives you that certain smile
Just remember under that woman's breast may beat the heart of a child
Don't you let yourself be the one to help a mixed up kids go wild
